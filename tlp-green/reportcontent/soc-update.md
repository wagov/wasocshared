## A word from the SOC

The Cyber Security Policy is intended to apply to the WA Public Sector (as defined in the Public Sector Management Act 1994). Other WA Government organisations are also encouraged to comply with the provisions of this Policy.

Agencies whose cyber security teams have enrolled in the DGov Incident Reporting Portal (IRP) should raise an incident within the portal.

In addition, DGov is offering the opportunity to subscribe to these and other IOC’s via Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) / Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII). If you have any queries regarding the new beta threat intelligence sharing, please do not hesitate to reach out directly to Mr Joshua Hitchen – Joshua.hitchen@dpc.wa.gov.au
