## A word from the SOC

The WA Security Operations Centre (WA SOC) has recently been investing into reporting, detection quality and threat intelligence. We have recently published documentation including a [check list to self-assess your SIEM's ingestion quality](https://wagov.github.io/wasocshared/#/onboarding/baseline-event-ingestion). In addition the SOC's Automated Indicator Sharing service (AIS) is currently in Preview for WA based agencies with tooling that can ingest STIX bundles using a TAXII endpoint, e.g. [Connect Microsoft Sentinel to a TAXII feed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-threat-intelligence-taxii). If you would like more information about AIS, please contact [Joshua Hitchen](mailto:joshua.hitchen@dpc.wa.gov.au).

For general (non-urgent) security advice and incident collaboration, it's most efficient to coordinate via the [WA SOC Service Desk](https://wagov.github.io/wasocshared/#/docs/incident-reporting.md). Please note that emails to cybersecurity@dpc.wa.gov.au are still monitored. For any urgent matters please call **1800 922 923 (1800 WA CYBER)**.
