# DevSecOps Induction

## 1. Getting Started

[The Learning Journey](https://taggartinstitute.org/p/the-learning-journey) is an excellent starting point for how to self teach using resources like those below.

By the end of the learning journey course, the learner should be able to:

- Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking and planning
- Recognize the various [levels of learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy)
- Create a Learning Plan and Study Map to guide their journey (also see [Maker Skill Trees](https://github.com/sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree))
- Effectively evaluate learning/information resources for quality and appropriateness
- Self-assess learning via metacognition
- Create Exhibitions of Mastery to demonstrate success

![Blooms Taxonomy](../images/blooms-taxonomy.png)

Note: Timeline estimates assume 5-10 hours of study per week alongside regular work duties. Progress may vary based on prior experience and available study time.

## 2. Free Training Resources

These are our recommended resources for building core technical skillsets.

### 2.1. Cloud Native Fundamentals (4-6 weeks)

### 2.2. Cloud Platform Essentials (2-3 weeks)

These are intro courses and security overviews of the major AWS and Azure platforms (as they use a lot of cloud specific nomenclature it's worth getting across).

#### AWS Resources

- [Amazon EKS Quickstart: Deploy a web app and store data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/quickstart.html)
- [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/courses/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials)
- [AWS Security Fundamentals Second Edition](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/courses/48/aws-security-fundamentals)

#### Azure Resources

- [Microsoft AKS Quickstart: Deploy an application from a code repository](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/automatic/quick-automatic-from-code)
- [Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/az-900t00)
- [Microsoft Security Academy](https://microsoft.github.io/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-security-academy/start)

### 2.3. Development Paths

Understanding the [OWASP Projects](https://owasp.org/projects/) focused on Secure Development Life Cycleâ€™s (SDLC) will help in getting across the common security capabilities platforms and software should generally have. The below **Data Integration** and **Frontend Frameworks** all are typically secure by default, however the way they are deployed can significantly change their risk profile. For production or high risk environments itâ€™s always best to review the operational procedures against the 2 above standards.

#### Backend Development (4-6 weeks)

Expected outcomes: Basic programming skills, understanding of software design principles and secure development practices

For backends, using a modern API framework like [Huma](https://huma.rocks/why/) ([Your First API tutorial](https://huma.rocks/tutorial/your-first-api/)) is strongly recommended. There is a great video series on Golang as well below:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?si=fpNruzeYKKF1woJZ&amp;list=PLoILbKo9rG3skRCj37Kn5Zj803hhiuRK6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

##### Software and code security

- [Safestack intro course](https://safestack.io/free-application-security-program/)
- [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) for software executing on servers (such as Websites and APIâ€™s) - default to ASVS Level 2
- [OWASP Mobile ASVS](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/) for software executing on clients (such as Mobile Applications) - default to MAS-L2
- Testing & QA - Scan for vulnerabilities and configuration/secret issues with [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/), [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler) and [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov). Run static analysis of codebases to find common issues with [semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep), [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql) or [Snyq](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli).
- Testing & QA - Test websites with [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and APIs with [Hurl](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl) or [Grafana K6](https://github.com/grafana/k6).

#### Data Integration (2-3 weeks each)

Expected outcomes: Understanding how to ingest/manage data with Python and SQL and generate reports with Markdown

Start with building a web app using [evidence.dev](https://docs.evidence.dev/build-your-first-app/) (that makes it easy to generate slick [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/cheat-sheet.html) visuals). Once you have the basics of how to collate and view data with SQL, then dive into the [SQLMesh CLI quickstart](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart/cli/) to understand how SQL (and python) can be used to transform data at scale. The large number of [execution engines](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/overview/) SQLMesh can use in addition to the [DuckDB Friendly SQL](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/dialect/friendly_sql.html) its in memory processing can do should make almost any data activities easy to model, test and execute.

Massive datasets should use approaches like [incremental by time range](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/incremental_time/) which enable only loading relevant chunks of data as needed. Using the [Athena](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/engines/athena/) execution engine across [Amazon S3 Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables.html) makes it straightforward to run a managed [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) data lake that is suitable for petabyte scale datasets.

Some reporting requirements lead to static / document style reports, in which case [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html) is an excellent open-source scientific and technical publishing system, that supports [Hugo markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/hugo.html) for simple documents and [Typst](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html) for advanced typesetting.

For more details on the languages used by the above tools, see below:

- [DuckDB SQL Introduction](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction.html)
- [Python by example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)
- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

#### Frontend frameworks (1-2 weeks each)

- [JavaScript](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/) (understand JS basics)

The below frameworks are all focused on having simple, minimal code easy for small teams to maintain.

- [Streamlit](https://edit.share.stlite.net) in browser python prototypes can be used for fast prototypes in python that compiles to browser.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) are fast simple static site generators.
- [Astro](https://astro.build) is extensible with Javascript/Typescript.
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is extensible with Python/Jinja.

## 3. Paid Certifications (2-3 months)

The SANS courses / certifications are the hardest (at least 50-100hrs study effort per cert) but most in depth:

- [SANS SEC540: Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-devsecops-automation/) - Operations Focus
- [SANS SEC522: Application Security: Securing Web Applications, APIs, and Microservices](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/application-security-securing-web-apps-api-microservices/) - Development Focus

Otherwise the lower cost certs below are all a fair bit shorter while also being high quality:

- [Linux Foundation Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) + Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) + Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) Exam Bundle](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/cka-ckad-cks-exam-bundle/)
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
