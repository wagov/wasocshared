## Baselines & Guidelines

Baselines are for use as self-assessment checklists, and guidelines are for general implementation guidance.

!!! abstract "Baselines"

    The WA SOC has developed a [Baseline for Event Ingestion](baselines/data-sources.md). It's currently under review to align with [MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://attack.mitre.org) and develop detection coverage/quality into a standalone baseline. See [MITRE Data Sources](https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/) for SIEM (sensors/events) coverage and [MITRE Tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/) for SIEM automated detection coverage.

!!! danger "Critical Infrastructure Entities"

    The [CISA Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals) detail very effective network and server hardening controls that are a highly valuable addition to the ACSC Essential 8, especially for entities in scope of [SOCI regulatory obligations](https://www.cisc.gov.au/legislative-information-and-reforms/critical-infrastructure/regulatory-obligations).

!!! tip "Guidelines"

    - [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-securing-remote-access-software) - remote access software overview, including the malicious use of remote access software, detection methods, and recommendations for all organizations.

    - [Network Management Guideline](guidelines/network-management.md) - Implementation guidance for [ACSC Network gateway hardening](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/gateway-hardening/gateway-security-guidance-package-executive-guidance).
