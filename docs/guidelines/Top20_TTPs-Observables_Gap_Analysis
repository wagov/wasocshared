# **Observables Gap Analysis**
The following listed queries would help identify observables per endpoints 


The chart below depicts most seen observables per [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) tactic source: ([OSSEM project](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM))

## 1. Process Creation  
The following are common log sources for Process Creation events and relating kql queries to identify number of endpoints providing these observables.

| Log source  |    KQL    | 
|-------------|-----------|
| Audit Policy (SecurityEvent) | SecurityEvent \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| where EventID == 4688 \| summarize count_distinct(Computer) | 
| Sysmon (Event) | Event \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| where Source == "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" \| where EventID == 1 \| summarize count_distinct(Computer) |
| Defender (DeviceProcessEvents) | DeviceProcessEvents \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| summarize count_distinct(DeviceName) |
| AzureAD (VMProcess) | VMProcess \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| where isnotempty(ExecutableName) \| summarize count_distinct(Computer) |

## 2. Process Command Line   
The following kql queries will provide number of endpoints with [Command Line logging enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/command-line-process-auditing). 

| Log type   |   KQL    |
|---------|-----------|
| Audit Policy (SecurityEvent) | SecurityEvent \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| where EventID == 4688 \| where isnotempty(CommandLine) \| summarize count_distinct(Computer) |
| AzureAD: VMProcess | VMProcess \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| where isnotempty(CommandLine) \|summarize count_distinct(Computer) |  
| DeviceProcessEvents | DeviceProcessEvents \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| where isnotempty(InitiatingProcessCommandLine) or isnotempty(ProcessCommandLine) \| summarize count_distinct(DeviceName) |   

## 3. Parent Process  

| Log type   |   KQL    |
|---------|-----------|
| Audit Policy (SecurityEvent) | SecurityEvent \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| where EventID == 4688 \| where isnotempty(ParentProcessName) \| summarize count_distinct(Computer) |

| Email Attachment Info      | EmailAttachmentInfo \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| summarize Time = max(TimeGenerated)     |
| Email Url Info             | EmailUrlInfo \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| summarize  Time = max(TimeGenerated)            |
| Email Post Delivery Events | EmailPostDeliveryEvents \| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) \| summarize  Time = max(TimeGenerated) |
