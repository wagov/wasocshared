### 1.1 Cyber Incident Response Plan

All agencies should have a [Cyber Incident Response Plan](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/publications/cyber-incident-response-plan) defined that clearly outlines the work to ensure an effective response and prompt recovery in the event security controls donâ€™t prevent an incident occurring. This plan should be tested and regularly reviewed.

ACSC also publishes an excellent [ACSC Cyber Incident Response Plan - Word Template (docx)](../pdfs/ACSC-Cyber-Incident-Response-Plan-Template.docx) suitable for tailoring to an organisations specific context. It includes some highly relevant appendices:
