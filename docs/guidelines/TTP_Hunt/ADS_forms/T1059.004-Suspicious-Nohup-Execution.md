#### ATT&CK TACTICS

{{ mitre("T1059.004")}}

Data Source(s): Command, Process

#### SENTINEL RULE QUERY

```
DeviceProcessEvents 
| where ActionType == 'ProcessCreated'
| where FolderPath endswith '/nohup' and ProcessCommandLine contains '/tmp/'
//| summarize count(), num_distinctDevices = dcount(DeviceName), set_ProcessCMD=make_set(ProcessCommandLine), set_InitiatingProcessCMD=make_set(InitiatingProcessCommandLine), first_ = min(TimeGenerated), last_ = max(TimeGenerated) by InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName, FolderPath, FileName, AccountName, TenantId 
```

#### Triage

Verify whether execution of nohup command in tmp folder is expected or approved
Analyse the account involved with nohup activity and determine whether is compromised

#### FalsePositive

- Administrators or installed processes that leverage nohup
