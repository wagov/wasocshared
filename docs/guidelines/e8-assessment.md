# Essential Eight Assessment Process Guide 2022
**First published:** November 2022
**Last updated:** August 2023

## Introduction

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the _[Strategies to
Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents)_, to help organisations protect themselves against various cyber threats. The most
effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.

This publication details a process for undertaking assessments of the Essential Eight. In doing so, it includes guidance on
assessment methods that can be used for assessing both the implementation and effectiveness of controls that
underpin the Essential Eight – as articulated within the _[Essential Eight Maturity Model](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight)_ (November 2022 release).

This publication should be read and used in conjunction with other ASD guidance and tools. This includes the:

## Overview

Assessments against the Essential Eight are conducted using the _[Essential Eight Maturity Model](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight)_. This maturity model
describes three target maturity levels (Maturity Level One through to Maturity Level Three) which are based on
mitigating increasing levels of targeting and tradecraft. The maturity model also includes Maturity Level Zero which
exists for capturing instances in which the requirements of Maturity Level One are not met.

Although the approach to conducting an assessment depends on the size and complexity of a system, there are
foundational principles that are common to each assessment. As such, the guidance in this publication should be
incorporated by assessors, noting that assessors should still use their own judgement and expertise.

While the Essential Eight may be applied to a non-Microsoft Windows system, specific mitigation strategies, or parts
thereof, may not be applicable or even the most effective mitigation strategies available. In these instances, such as for
[Linux workstations and servers](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight), cloud computing or [enterprise mobility](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility), organisations should consider alternative
guidance provided by ASD.

Finally, in determining compensating control effectiveness, assessors should ensure that any compensating controls
that have been implemented provide an equivalent level of protection to those recommended under the Essential Eight. This will assist in ensuring that an equivalent level of overall protection against a specific level of targeting and
tradecraft can be achieved and maintained.

## Evidence quality

In conducting an assessment, assessors need to gather and review credible evidence to support conclusions they draw
on the effectiveness of controls. In general terms, the evidence used to determine the effectiveness of controls will vary
in quality depending on the approach taken. As such, when conducting an assessment, assessors should seek to gather
and use the highest quality evidence where reasonably practicable. This guide defines four levels of evidence quality:

- **Excellent evidence:** Testing a control with a simulated activity designed to confirm it is in place and effective (e.g. attempting to run an application to check application control rulesets).
- **Good evidence:** Reviewing the configuration of a system through the system’s interface to determine whether it should enforce an expected policy.
- **Fair evidence:** Reviewing a copy of a system’s configuration (e.g. using reports or screenshots) to determine
    whether it should enforce an expected policy.
- **Poor evidence:** A policy or verbal statement of intent (e.g. sighting mention of controls within documentation).

## Determining effective implementation of mitigation strategies

Upon concluding assessment activities, assessors will need to determine whether mitigation strategies were
implemented effectively or not. This determination requires a combination of judgement and consideration of the
following factors:

- adoption of a risk-based approach to the implementation of mitigation strategies
- ability to test the mitigation strategies across an accurate representative sample of workstations (including laptops), servers and network devices
- level of assurance gained from assessment activities and any evidence provided (noting the quality of evidence)
- any exceptions, including associated compensating controls, and whether they have been accepted by an appropriate authority as part of a formal exception process.

Assessors should use ASD’s standardised assessment outcomes which are:

- **Effective:** The organisation is effectively meeting the control’s objective.
- **Ineffective:** The organisation is not adequately meeting the control’s objective.
- **Alternate control:** The organisation is effectively meeting the control’s objective through an alternate control.
- **Not assessed:** The control has not yet been assessed.
- **Not applicable:** The control does not apply to the system or environment.
- **No visibility:** The assessor was unable to obtain adequate visibility of a control’s implementation.

It is important that assessors do not allow organisational risk acceptance without sufficient compensating controls as a
justification for not implementing a mitigation strategy (e.g. a system owner has risk accepted not implementing application control or multi-factor authentication). In these scenarios, without adequate compensating controls, the mitigation strategy is considered to be not implemented.

For a system owner to claim they have implemented a mitigation strategy, all controls specified within the mitigation
strategy must be assessed as ‘effective’ or ‘alternate control’. If one of the controls specified for a mitigation strategy is assessed as ‘ineffective’, the system owner cannot claim to have met the requirements for that maturity level. In turn, this applies to the determination of whether a system owner has met the target maturity level for their system (i.e. if one or more mitigation strategies are deemed to be not implemented then the target maturity level for the system
cannot be claimed to have been met).

Where exceptions to a mitigation strategy’s controls have been identified, the assessor should review and evaluate any compensating controls that are in place to determine whether they address the intent of the original controls and are implemented effectively. Two examples have been provided below.

| **Example 1** | During an internal review, an organisation identified a low-risk Windows server that could not be patched. As a result, the organisation implemented a plan to decommission the server within two months. In this situation, it was still important for the organisation to apply compensating controls that reduced the risk to an acceptable level, and to align with the requirements of the Essential Eight’s exception process. As a result, a risk owner was assigned, and strong compensating controls were put in place. In this instance, as the exception was being effectively managed and strong compensating controls were in place, an assessor determined that the exception should not preclude the organisation from reaching their target maturity level. Conversely, if the organisation had not applied strong compensating controls, it would not have aligned with the requirements of the Essential Eight’s exception process and should have precluded the organisation from reaching their target maturity level. |

It is important that the use of exceptions for a system are documented and approved by an appropriate authority
through a formal process. Documentation for exceptions should include the following:

- detail, scope and justification for exceptions
- detail of compensating controls associated with exceptions, including:
    - detail, scope and justification for compensating controls
    - expected implementation lifetime of compensating controls
    - when compensating controls will next be reviewed
- system risk rating before and after the implementation of compensating controls
- any caveats placed on the use of the system as a result of exceptions
- acceptance by an appropriate authority of the residual risk for the system
- when the necessity of exceptions will next be considered by an appropriate authority (noting exceptions should
    not be approved beyond one year).

The appropriate use of a formal exception process, along with compensating controls, should not preclude an
organisation from being assessed as meeting the requirements for their target maturity level.

## Stages of an assessment

At a high-level, assessments are comprised of four stages:

- **Stage 1:** The assessor plans and prepares for the assessment.
- **Stage 2 :** The assessor determines the scope and approach for the assessment.
- **Stage 3 :** The assessor assesses the controls associated with each of the mitigation strategies.
- **Stage 4 :** The assessor develops the security assessment report.

The activities and considerations for each stage of an assessment are discussed in further detail below.

## Stage 1: Assessment planning and preparation

### Assessment planning

Prior to commencing an assessment, the assessor should conduct assessment planning activities. These activities
require the assessor to discuss with the system owner:

- system classification and assessment scope (see further detail below)
- access to low and high-privileged user accounts, devices, documentation, personnel, and facilities
- intended assessment approach and any approvals required to run scripts and tools (see further detail below)
- evidence collection and protection, including any requirements following the conclusion of the assessment
- where the security assessment report will be developed (e.g. on an assessor’s device or on an alternative device)
- approach to stakeholder engagement and consultation (including key points of contact)
- whether any managed service providers or other outsourced providers manage any aspects of the system
    (including appropriate points of contact)
- access to any relevant prior security assessment reports for the system
- appropriate use, retention and marketing of the security assessment report by both parties.

Assessors may also develop an assessment test plan and share it with the system owner.

## Stage 2: Determination of assessment scope and approach

### Determine assessment scope

In determining the assessment scope, assessors should first clarify the target maturity level with the system owner,
noting that the Essential Eight is required to be implemented and assessed as a package. For example, if a system
owner has not previously had an assessment demonstrating that they have implemented Maturity Level One, they
should not begin an assessment against Maturity Level Two until they have done so, and likewise for Maturity Level
Two before being assessed against Maturity Level Three.

Having identified a suitable target maturity level, the assessor should familiarise themselves with the requirements for that maturity level as it will impact the components or aspects of the system within scope of the assessment. At this time it may also be useful to request an approximate percentage breakdown of the operating systems used on workstations and servers for the system.

Once the scope of the assessment has been identified, and agreed upon with the system owner, a more accurate determination of the assessment’s duration and any milestones will likely be possible.

The scope of the assessment should be documented within the security assessment report. Any components or aspects of a system deemed out-of-scope should also be documented and accompanied by a justification for their exclusion.

### Determine assessment approach

In determining a suitable assessment approach, both qualitative and quantitative testing techniques should be considered. For example, qualitative testing techniques include documentation reviews and interviews with personnel administering or managing system security, while quantitative testing techniques include system configuration reviews and the use of scripts and tools. Sample sizes for testing should also be determined in consultation with the system owner, with the aim to assess an accurate representative sample population of workstations (including laptops), servers and network devices.

Conducting assessments using interviews, reports and screenshots will always be inferior to conducting assessments using scripts and tools. Particularly as scripts and tools often assess many workstations and servers on a network, rather than a single sample workstation or server, and often identify issues that may be missed in interviews or overlooked by human analysis of reports and configuration settings. If adequate assessment scripts and tools are not already present
on a system, assessors may wish to use their own scripts and tools following approval by the system owner.

Any assessment limitations including sample sizes and constraints on technical testing should be documented within the security assessment report.

## Stage 3 : Assessment of controls

The assessment of each mitigation strategy is performed by reviewing and testing the effectiveness of controls. This section provides guidance on the approach to assessing each mitigation strategy at a given target maturity level, along with relevant assessment considerations. Guidance on determining the effectiveness of the controls within each mitigation strategy is also provided within this section.

Assessment guidance for maturity levels in this section is cumulative. For example, the guidance provided in the Maturity Level Two section is focused on unique requirements above those of Maturity Level One. Likewise, the guidance provided in the Maturity Level Three section is focused on unique requirements above those of Maturity Level Two. This aligns with the manner in which assessments should be conducted against target maturity levels.

### Maturity Level One

The focus of this maturity level is malicious actors who are content to simply leverage commodity tradecraft that is widely available to gain access to, and control of, a system. For example, malicious actors opportunistically using a publicly-available exploit for a vulnerability in an unpatched internet-facing service, or authenticating to an internet- facing service using credentials that were stolen, reused, brute forced or guessed.

Generally, malicious actors are looking for any victim rather than a specific victim and will opportunistically seek common weaknesses in many targets rather than investing heavily in gaining access to a specific target. Malicious actors will employ common social engineering techniques to trick users into weakening the security of a system and executing malicious code, for example, via a Microsoft Office macro.

Malicious actors will also often seek to compromise user accounts. If successful, they may seek to exploit privileges associated with these accounts or escalate privileges to higher levels. Depending on their intent, malicious actors may also seek to steal or destroy data (including backups) or make data otherwise unavailable through various denial-of-service techniques.

#### Application control

#### Context

Application control assessments can be done without tools but efforts will be severely limited in their effectiveness and are likely to miss edge cases that malicious actors would look to exploit. For example, malicious actors may use custom tools to scan for weak or vulnerable paths on a system. This could be achieved with a Microsoft Office macro.

It is important to note that the last major update to the maturity model introduced compiled Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) (.chm files), HTML applications (.hta files) and control panel applets (.cpl files) to the list of file types that need to be controlled. Depending on the application control solution selected, it may not support these file types.

When conducting assessments, paths for standard user profiles and temporary folders used by operating systems, web browsers, and email clients can include those from the list below. Note, depending on the system configuration, there may be overlap (e.g. %temp% and %tmp% generally reside within %userprofile%\*).

```
 %userprofile%\*
 %temp%\*
 %tmp%\*
 %windir%\Temp\*.
```

To check if application control is implemented within the user profile directory, attempt to run a benign executable file inside the directory. The executables tested should cover .exe, .com, .dll, .ocx, .ps 1 , .bat, .vbs, .js, .msi, .mst, .msp, .chm, .hta, and .cpl. If any of the executables run within the user profile directory or operating system temporary folders, application control is ineffective.

Note, while a dedicated application control solution is not required at Maturity Level One (i.e. file system permissions can be used instead), organisations may still choose to implement a dedicated application control solution if they intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Two.

#### Assessment guidance

The section below provides guidance tailored to the assessment method. When selecting a method, the quality of the evidence provided by each method should be strongly considered.

Note, the ‘whoami /groups’ command would also need to be run to determine which user groups a typical standard user belonged to in order to determine the effective permissions for each path.

#### Patch applications

#### Context

Most vendors of internet-facing services regularly release updated versions of their applications to fix vulnerabilities.
Applications that exist on a system can be compared to the latest versions available from the vendor to determine whether existing versions are the latest, and if not, how long-ago updates were made available by the vendor, based on release dates and patch notes. Services such as the [SANS Internet Storm Centre](https://isc.sans.edu/), [Microsoft Security Response Centre](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc?oneroute=true) or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s _[Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)_ can be used to determine whether public exploits exist for a given internet-facing service.

#### Configure Microsoft Office macro settings

#### Context

All users should be denied the ability to execute Microsoft Office macros by default unless they have a specific business requirement. If certain users are required to run Microsoft Office macros, they should be restricted to only the specific applications required (rather than all Microsoft Office applications). In addition, a record of their business requirement and associated approvals should be kept. This record should align with the list of users within the Active Directory group that have permission to run Microsoft Office macros. Note, once a business requirement can no longer be
demonstrated by a user, permission to run Microsoft Office macros should be revoked.

Microsoft Defender is commonly used to perform Microsoft Office macro antivirus scanning. This product uses the Antimalware Scan Interface to integrate applications and services with any antimalware installed on a machine. Other antivirus solutions may use this interface or other processes to scan Microsoft Office macros.

Microsoft Office applications that can execute Microsoft Office macros include Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Word.

#### User application hardening

#### Context

Malicious actors are known to indiscriminately use ‘malvertising’ in their attempts to compromise systems. Blocking web advertisements using web browser add-ins or extensions, or via web content filtering, can prevent the compromise of a system.

Internet Explorer 11 lacks many of the security features of modern web browsers and ceased to be supported by Microsoft on 15 June 2022. As such, it is more regularly targeted by malicious actors. Ideally, Internet Explorer 11 should be removed from systems and Microsoft Edge (running in ‘IE mode’ for legacy sites), or other modern web browsers, should be used instead.

Web browser security settings should be configured via group policy settings. In addition, default web browser security settings should not be relied upon as users may tinker with these settings to enable content or change settings when guided to do so by malicious actors. Web browser security settings that are configured via group policy settings typically appear greyed out to users, have a hover over message explaining the setting is configured by their organisation or have an icon such as a padlock.

#### Restrict administrative privileges

#### Context

Policies, processes and procedures for managing privileged access to systems should be documented and enforced within organisational workflows. In doing so, privileged access to systems and applications should be requested via a form, service desk ticket or email from users, and require approval from a supervisor or application owner, to maintain a record of all such requests. System owners should also maintain a list of all applications on their system that require privileged access.

Privileged accounts are often targeted by malicious actors for their greater control and access to organisational resources. For this reason, privileged accounts should not have access to the internet, email and web services.

Note, while no constraints are placed on how privileged and unprivileged operating environments are separated for privileged users at Maturity Level One, organisations may choose to implement an approach that avoids virtualising a privileged operating environment within an unprivileged operating environment if they intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Two.

#### Patch operating systems

#### Context

Operating system vendors regularly publish updates to address vulnerabilities. In addition, unsupported and out-of-date operating systems of internet-facing workstations and servers are a common target for malicious actors.

While operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices that are not internet-facing are at a lower risk ofexploitation, as malicious actors need to compromise another system to then obtain network-based access to the unpatched operating system, it is still important that such operating systems are patched in a reasonable timeframe given the level of targeting and tradecraft the system owner is attempting to protect their system against.

Services such as the [SANS Internet Storm Centre](https://isc.sans.edu/), [Microsoft Security Response Centre](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc?oneroute=true) or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s _[Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)_ can be used to determine whether public exploits exist for operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices.

#### Multi-factor authentication

#### Context

Multi-factor authentication is one of the most effective controls an organisation can implement to prevent malicious factors from gaining access to a system, service or application. When implemented correctly, multi-factor authentication can also make it significantly more difficult for malicious actors to steal legitimate credentials to facilitate further malicious activities.

Multi-factor authentication should be implemented for remote access solutions, users performing privileged actions and users of important data repositories. Using multi-factor authentication provides a secure authentication mechanism that is not as susceptible to brute force attacks, such as traditional single-factor authentication methods based on memorised secrets (e.g. personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords and passphrases).

At this maturity level, any two or more authentication methods can be used as long as they are not of the same class (e.g. something users know, something users have or something users are). There is no requirement that one factor must be a memorised secret. Biometrics and [Trusted Signals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/multifactor-unlock?tabs=intune) are also acceptable as an authentication method at this maturity level.

Note, while any two or more authentication methods can be used at Maturity Level One, organisations may still choose to implement multi-factor authentication solutions, such as those that include something the user has or are phishing-resistant, if they intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Two or Maturity Level Three.

#### Regular backups

#### Context

Backup and retention frequencies should be defined by the system owner in accordance with their organisation’s business continuity and disaster recovery requirements. In doing so, it is important that restoration of systems and data from backups be tested as part of regular (at least annual) disaster recovery exercises and not left to after the first major security incident is experienced.

At this maturity level, it is important that unprivileged users cannot access the backups of any other users – although it is not necessarily a problem if they are able to access their own backups. It is worth noting, at this maturity level, that privileged accounts may still be able to access the backups of any user.

While unprivileged accounts can access (i.e. read) their own backups, it is important that they do not have the ability to modify or delete those backups. This requirement exists as any ransomware running with the privileges of an unprivileged user should be blocked from overwriting or deleting backups. Note, malicious actors escalating privileges to privileged accounts, or backup administrator accounts, to overwrite backups are addressed at higher maturity levels.

### Maturity Level Two

The focus of this maturity level is malicious actors operating with a modest step-up in capability from the previous maturity level. These malicious actors are willing to invest more time in a target and, perhaps more importantly, in the effectiveness of their tools. For example, these malicious actors will likely employ well-known tradecraft to better attempt to bypass controls implemented by a target and evade detection. This includes actively targeting credentials using phishing and employing technical and social engineering techniques to circumvent weaker methods of multi-factor authentication.

Generally, malicious actors are likely to be more selective in their targeting but still somewhat conservative in the time, money and effort they may invest in a target. Malicious actors will likely invest time to ensure their phishing is effective and employ common social engineering techniques to trick users into weakening the security of a system and executing malicious code, for example, via a Microsoft Office macro.

Malicious actors will also often seek to compromise user accounts. If successful, they may seek to exploit privileges associated with these accounts or escalate privileges to higher levels. Depending on their intent, malicious actors may also seek to steal or destroy data (including backups) or make data otherwise unavailable through various denial-of-service techniques.

The guidance below outlines the requirements to be assessed in addition to the requirements of the previous maturity level. In doing so, assessments against Maturity Level Two should focus on the delta between Maturity Level One and Maturity Level Two.

#### Application control

#### Context

For Maturity Level Two, application control requires the use of a dedicated application control solution. This may be one of the in-built solutions from Microsoft (e.g. AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control) or it may be a third-party solution (e.g. AirLock Digital’s AirLock, Ivanti’s Device and Application Control, Trend Micro Endpoint Application Control or VMWare Carbon Black App Control).

The majority of application control solutions will have a form of logging or auditing mode. As such, event logs for application control solutions should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber incident and they are required for forensic analysis or cyber incident response activities. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber incident, how it occurred and what vulnerabilities need to be mitigated.

month to two weeks. In addition, this maturity level introduces patching timeframes for additional applications, and an
increase in associated vulnerability scanning frequencies and scope.

#### Configure Microsoft Office macro settings

#### Context

At this maturity level, an additional requirement is introduced relating to the use of the attack surface reduction (ASR) rule ‘Block Win32 API calls from Office macros’. This ASR rule prevents Microsoft Office macros from calling Win32 APIs, which malicious actors can exploit to run malicious code that is more powerful than the actions they can perform using the Microsoft Office VBA macro language itself.

Event logs for Microsoft Office macro execution events should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber incident and they are required for forensic analysis or cyber incident response activities. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber incident, how it occurred and what vulnerabilities need to be mitigated.

#### User application hardening

#### Context

This maturity level requires the implementation of several ASR rules to prevent malicious actors from using Microsoft Office applications to create child processes that can be used to download and run malicious code, write malicious code to disk or inject malicious code into other processes. In addition, the ASR rule ‘Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes’ should be implemented to prevent malicious actors from using Adobe Reader to create child processes which can be used to download and run malicious code.
<br>Malicious actors often attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office through its support for Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) packages. This maturity level requires Microsoft Office to be configured to prevent activation of these OLE packages.

<br>The implementation of ACSC or vendor hardening guidance can assist in reducing the attack surface of applications. This is particularly important for key applications that are commonly targeted by malicious actors such as web browsers, Microsoft Office and Portable Document Format (PDF) software (e.g. Adobe Reader). In cases where ACSC hardening guidance conflicts with vendor hardening guidance, consideration should be given to what the hardening guidance is attempting to achieve.

Event logs for blocked attempts to execute PowerShell scripts should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber incident and they are required for forensic analysis or cyber incident response activities. This should not be confused with ‘module logging’, ‘script block logging’ and ‘transcription’ functionality of PowerShell, which while recommended for good cyber hygiene, are not within scope of Essential Eight assessments. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber incident, how it occurred and what vulnerabilities need to be
mitigated.

#### Restrict administrative privileges

#### Context

To avoid users collecting privileges and access as they change roles throughout an organisation, and to enforce the principle of least-privileged role-based access control, privileged users should be required to regularly revalidate their requirement for privileged access. As such, privileged accounts that have not been used within 45 days strongly indicate that they are no longer required. Rather than accounts remaining active, and a possible target for malicious actors to exploit, inactive accounts should be disabled on a regular basis.

For Maturity Level Two, privileged operating environments must not be virtualised within unprivileged operating environments. This constraint allows for three implementation scenarios:

- physically separate operating environments
- an unprivileged operating environment virtualised within a privileged operating environment
- both a privileged and unprivileged operating environment virtualised within a physical host’s hardened operating
    environment.

Jump servers play an important role as a centralised logging and tool enforcement point for administrative activities, even when privileged operating environments are used.

The use of a common local administrator password for every workstation and server is a common approach in poorly-secured networks due to its ease of use. A marginally more secure approach is using passwords that are a combinationof a fixed component and a dynamic component (e.g. including a unique asset identifier). While the latter may appear to be secure, if malicious actors are able to compromise one or more local administrator passwords they may be able to discern a pattern. Ideally, an approach that ensures local administrator and service accounts are unique, unpredictable and managed should be used. For example, Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=46899">Local Administrator Password Solution.</a>

Event logs relating to the use of, and changes to, privileged accounts should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber incident and they are required for forensic analysis or cyber incident response activities. Often, the lack of sufficient logging can impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber incident, how it occurred and what vulnerabilities need to be mitigated.

#### Multi-factor authentication

#### Context

At this maturity level, an additional requirement for all privileged users logging onto systems, both locally and remotely, to use multi-factor authentication is introduced. In addition, the authentication methods that can be used, and in what combination, are restricted to avoid weaker implementations. Specifically, acceptable multi-factor authentication implementations include:

- something users have (i.e. look-up secret, out-of-band device, single-factor one-time PIN (OTP) devices, single-
    factor cryptographic software or single factor cryptographic device) in addition to something users know (i.e. a
    memorised secret)
- something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (i.e. multi-factor OTP device, multi-factor
    cryptographic software or multi-factor cryptographic device).

Biometrics are not acceptable at this maturity level. This is due to biometric characteristics not being secrets, biometric matching being probabilistic rather than deterministic and there being a reliance on the security of biometric capture software installed on devices. However, biometrics can be used to unlock another authentication factor (e.g. a certificate stored in a Trusted Platform Module or an OTP generator app on a smartphone). [Trusted Signals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/multifactor-unlock?tabs=intune) are also not acceptable at this maturity level. This is due to issues associated with placing trust in the signal itself, which can be targeted and spoofed by malicious actors.

While not yet excluded at this maturity level, organisations may want to avoiding authentication methods increasingly being subject to MFA fatigue or social engineering attempts by malicious actors, such as push notifications and SMS codes.

Event logs for multi-factor authentication events should be collected and stored in case there is a cyber incident and they are required for forensic analysis or cyber incident response activities. The lack of sufficient logging can impact the ability to determine the extent of a cyber incident, how it occurred and what vulnerabilities need to be mitigated.

Note, at this maturity level organisations may choose to implement multi-factor authentication solutions that are phishing-resistant, such as security keys or smartcards, if they intend to eventually implement requirements for Maturity Level Three.

<td>Multi-factor authentication

<tr>
<td>Multi-factor authentication
uses either: something users

<td> Discuss the implementation of multi-factor authentication for users. Note, multiple

different systems and internet-facing services that users authenticate to. For example,
multi-factor authentication for administration of cloud services might involve a
different implementation to multi-factor authentication for administration of on-
premises services. Furthermore, not all third-party internet-facing services may offer
the same multi-factor authentication implementation.<br><br>Discussions should also include distinguishing between multi-step authentication and
multi-factor authentication, as well as different levels of security provided by different
multi-factor authentication implementations. For example, a security key or smartcard
is more secure than a hardware OTP device which is more secure than an OTP mobile
app which is more secure than a push notification or SMS code sent to a smartphone.</td>

</tr>
</table>

#### Regular backups

#### Context

At this maturity level, privileged accounts (with the exception of backup administrator accounts) are limited to only accessing their own backups, and should not be able to modify and delete backups.

It is important that backup administrator accounts (as well as user accounts in general) are provisioned following the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. As such, backup administrator accounts should only be given to a small group of trusted administrators and a separate group should be setup for the purpose of restoring backups.
Excessive permissions for accounts increases the chance that they will be compromised. Should this occur for these accounts, malicious actors performing ransomware attacks can easily encrypt or delete all backups.

### Maturity Level Three

The focus of this maturity level is malicious actors who are more adaptive and much less reliant on public tools and techniques. These malicious actors are able to exploit the opportunities provided by weaknesses in their target’s cyber security posture, such as the existence of older operating systems or inadequate logging and monitoring. Malicious actors do this to not only extend their access once initial access has been gained to a target, but to evade detection and solidify their presence. Malicious actors make swift use of exploits when they become publicly available as well as other
tradecraft that can improve their chance of success.

Generally, at this level, malicious actors are more focused on particular targets and, more importantly, are willing and able to invest effort into circumventing particular policy and technical controls implemented by their targets. For example, this includes socially engineering a user to execute a malicious Microsoft Office macro or circumventing multi-factor authentication implementations by stealing authentication token values to impersonate a user. Once a foothold
is gained on a system, malicious actors seek to gain privileged credentials or password hashes, pivot to other parts of a network, and cover their tracks. Depending on their intent, malicious actors may also destroy all data (including backups).

The guidance below outlines the requirements to be assessed in addition to the requirements of the previous maturity level. In doing so, assessments against Maturity Level Three should focus on the delta between Maturity Level Two and Maturity Level Three.

#### Application control

#### Context

At this maturity level, the scope of application control is expanded to include drivers and all servers (not just internet-facing servers). Note, while Microsoft AppLocker does not currently support the control of drivers, Windows Defender
Application Control (WDAC) does. This maturity level also includes the requirement for centralised logging of allowed and blocked execution events on workstations and servers.

Microsoft maintains a list of application control bypasses and malicious drivers that have been discovered by security researchers and malicious actors. Implementing Microsoft’s [recommended block rules](https://www.sans.org/blog/bloodhound-sniffing-out-path-through-windows-domains/) and [recommended driver block rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules) can help to provide protection from malicious actors that would have looked at using these against an otherwise robust application control implementation to gain access to a system.

When implementing an application control solution, an organisation may develop application control rulesets but fail to ensure they remains fit-for-purpose by reviewing them on a regular basis. This can lead to the potential failure to identify several scenarios, such as operating system vendors changing permissions on paths as part of updates or upgrades, exploitable applications or drivers remaining approved for a system, vendor code-signing certificates being compromised, or system administrators introducing exceptions to ‘get things working’ or troubleshoot but failing to
remove the workarounds afterwards. Each of these scenarios are real, having been observed during assessments, and introduce additional vulnerabilities into a system that may be exploited by malicious actors.

#### Patch applications

#### Context

At this maturity level, patches, updates or other vendor mitigations must be applied within 48 hours rather than two weeks if an exploit exists. In addition, all applications that are no longer supported by vendors should be removed.

This requirement can be assessed in a similar way to Maturity Level Two, except that if an exploit exists, patches, updates or other vendor mitigations must be applied within 48 hours rather than two weeks.

#### Configure Microsoft Office macro settings

#### Context

Disabling the use of Microsoft Office macros represents an optimal security outcome, however, some users will have a business requirement for their use. In such situations, additional controls should be implemented to make the use of Microsoft Office macros as secure as possible. This may include either running Microsoft Office macros from within a sandboxed environment, from an appropriately controlled Trusted Location or ensuring they are digitally signed by a trusted publisher.

As Microsoft Office allows any files that are opened from a Trusted Location to bypass security checks, it is critical that only trusted users can write to or modify content in these locations. Under no circumstances should Trusted Locations be specified within a user’s profile, such as their desktop or documents folders.

If the ‘Disable all macros except digitally signed macros’ setting is used, this will allow any Microsoft Office macro signed by a trusted publisher to execute without prompting the user for permission. However, any Microsoft Office macro that is digitally signed by an untrusted publisher will ask users to decide as to whether they would like to allow the Microsoft Office macro to execute via the Message Bar or Backstage View. While this prompt can be disabled using a group policy setting, the removal of the option to enable Microsoft Office macros via the Backstage View requires the
implementation of an undocumented graphical user interface setting.

When implementing a digitally signed Microsoft Office macro approach, an organisation may identify a list of trusted publishers but fail to review them on a regular basis for their ongoing suitability. This can create issues when a vendor’s code-signing certificate is compromised. Ideally, an organisation should acquire their own code-signing certificate and re-sign any Microsoft Office macros they trust, even if already signed by a third party. While introducing additional overhead, this mitigates the risk of trusting compromised third-party code-signing certificates.

#### User application hardening

#### Context

At this maturity level, Internet Explorer 11 must be disabled or removed from operating systems rather than just blocked from accessing the internet or opening files from the internet.

.NET Framework 3.5 (including .NET 2.0 and 3.0) is often targeted by malicious actors due to its lack of security functionality when compared to newer versions of the .NET Framework, as well as due to its linkages to PowerShell 2.0.
Within Microsoft Windows there are two separate features relating to the .NET Framework, ‘.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and .NET 3.0)’ and ‘.NET Framework 4.8 Advanced Services’.
Microsoft ended support for Windows PowerShell 2.0 in late 2017. At that time, Microsoft noted that Windows PowerShell 2.0 lacked the security functionality of Windows PowerShell 5.0 and higher.
Constrained Language Mode for PowerShell is designed to prevent PowerShell users (which may include malicious actors) from running tools that exploit PowerShell or load Component Object Model objects, libraries and classes into a PowerShell session.

#### Restrict administrative privileges

#### Context

Staff seeking access to systems and applications, especially with privileged access, should have a genuine business requirement to do so. Once a requirement to access a system or application is established, staff should be provided with only the privileges they require to undertake their duties. This can be achieved using role-based access controls.

Just-in-time (JIT) privileged access management (PAM) is an extension of role-based access control in which privileged users are only granted the access required to perform their duties immediately before that access is required and for only as long as it is required.

Within an active user session, credentials are cached within the Local Security Authority System Service process to allow for access to network resources without users having to repeatedly enter their credentials. Windows Defender Credential Guard is designed to assist in protecting this process. Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard provides a similar functionality for remote access.

#### Patch operating systems

#### Context

At this maturity level, patches, updates or other vendor mitigations for vulnerabilities in operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices are required to be applied within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists.

Modern operating systems for workstations, servers and network devices often contain security functionality that is not available in earlier releases, even if those earlier releases remain supported by vendors. It is important that an organisation takes advantage of new security functionality in later releases to further mitigate malicious actors’
activities.

The latest release of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Server will depend on the servicing branch being used. Further [release information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/release-health/release-information) is available from Microsoft. Similar information is often available from vendors of network devices.

#### Multi-factor authentication

#### Context

At this maturity level, all users of important data repositories should be using multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, the types and combinations of multi-factor authentication are further restricted to avoid weaker forms of multi-factor authentication, especially those susceptible to phishing attacks. This can be achieved by ensuring that clients cryptographically verify the authenticity of the server that they are authenticating to. For example, using phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication would result in fake Microsoft 365 login pages being identified as such, rather than fooling users and capturing their credentials (including additional authentication factors).

The acceptable forms of multi-factor authentication at this maturity level are generally limited to including either a security key, smartcard or Trusted Platform Module.

#### Regular backups

#### Context

At this maturity level, only a subset of privileged accounts (i.e. backup administrator accounts) should be able to access backups. The increasing level of controls around which accounts can access backups, and to what extent, progressively limits the damage that may be caused by a ransomware incident.

In addition, at this maturity level, all accounts (except for break glass accounts) should not be able to modify and delete
backups.

## Stage 4 : Development of the security assessment report

In developing the security assessment report, assessors should use the _[Essential Eight Assessment Report Template](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide)_.
However, assessors can use their own report templates for branding purposes if all sections from the template are included.

## Further information

The _[Information Security Manual](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism)_ is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems
and data from cyber threats. The advice in the _[Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents,](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents)_ along with its [Essential
Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight), complements this framework.

A mapping between the requirements of the _[Essential Eight Maturity Model](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight)_ and the _[Information Security Manual](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism)_ can be found in the _[Essential Eight Maturity Model to ISM Mapping](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model-ism-mapping)_ publication.
