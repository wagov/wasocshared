# Secure Configuration Assessment Guideline

This guideline is intended to define a simple approach to ongoing monitoring and assurance of secure configuration of common tools and platforms.

## Email, File sharing and Endpoint configuration monitoring

The standard recommended actions within [Microsoft Defender](https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=actions) should be reviewed and exported each month and retained for 12 months.

### Enhanced validation of cloud service configuration

A backup of tenant configuration should be taken each month with [Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration](https://microsoft365dsc.com) and archived to a Git repository or equivalent VCS tool that allows monitoring of configuration drift.

A tool to review tenant configuration such as the [CISA ScubaGear M365 Secure Configuration Baseline Assessment Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear) should be run against all tenants at least quarterly with results reviewed and retained for 12 months to guide policy remediations and improvements.

### Enhanced validation of endpoint configuration

The [ACSCâ€™s Cyber Toolbox](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/news/essential-eight-assessment-guidance-package) is comprised of the Essential Eight Maturity Verification Tool (E8MVT) and the Application Control Verification Tool (ACVT) which should be run against a sampling of endpoints on at least a quarterly basis with results reviewed and retained for 12 months to guide policy remediations and improvements.

## Infrastructure (public cloud and on-premise compute and storage) configuration monitoring

The standard recommended actions within CSPM tools such as [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/~/5), [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), [Oracle Cloud Guard](https://www.oracle.com/au/security/cloud-security/cloud-guard/) and [Google Cloud Security Command Centre](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center) should be reviewed and exported each month and retained for 12 months. It is strongly recommended to ensure checks are configured against the ACSC ISM and NIST CSF (SP 800-53 R5) using compliance dashboards where possible:

- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Compliance Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/update-regulatory-compliance-packages)
- [Deploying a Conformance Pack Using the AWS Config Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-pack-console.html)
- [Oracle Cloud Guard](https://www.oracle.com/au/security/cloud-security/cloud-guard/) and [Oracle Data Safe](https://www.oracle.com/au/security/database-security/data-safe/)
- [Google Cloud Security Command Centre](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center)

## Essential Eight Implementation

The [ASD's Blueprint for Secure Cloud (process focused)](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au/) and [Microsoft Compliance - ACSC Essential Eight (technical focus)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/essential-eight/e8-overview) are being regularly updated, and have in depth guidance aligned to this technical reference.

Small entities should also review the [ACSCs Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight) Microsoft 365 [Cloud Security Guides](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cloud-security-guides). Our below links reference security platforms and tools that have been seen to simplify establishment and monitoring of controls as per the [ACSC Essential Eight Process Guide](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide) and reduce [Supply Chain Risk](../guidelines/supply-chain-risk-mgmt.md) (where possible [Certified Service Providers](https://www.hostingcertification.gov.au/certified-service-providers) tooling has been referenced).

### Application Control

[ASD Blueprint](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au/security-and-governance/essential-eight/application-control/), [ACSC Technical Example](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cloud-security-guide/technical-example-application-control)

- Start with [Essential Eight application control using AppLocker for ML1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/essential-eight/e8-app-control#essential-eight-application-control-using-applocker-for-ml1) (simple 3 path block rule)
- For modern approaches to [WDAC for ML2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/essential-eight/e8-app-control#essential-eight-application-control-using-wdac-for-ml2) see [Intune ACSC Windows Hardening Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-ACSC-Windows-Hardening-Guidelines)
- If above is still high complexity due to number of legacy or packaged applications review a third party tool like [AirLock Digital](https://www.airlockdigital.com)
- Other effective tools: [Ivanti Application Control](https://www.ivanti.com/en-au/products/application-control), [Trend Vision One Application Control](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-vision-one-application-control_001), [VMWare Carbon Black App Control](https://www.vmware.com/products/app-control.html)

[ASD Blueprint](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au/security-and-governance/essential-eight/multi-factor-authentication/), [ACSC Technical Example](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cloud-security-guide/technical-example-multi-factor-authentication)

Once [Entra ID passwordless](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless) configured, below migrations will get identities and data into compliant states and locations

- [Combat fake emails (ACSC)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/email-hardening/how-combat-fake-emails) by enabling [DKIM/DMARC/SPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-about?view=o365-worldwide#how-to-avoid-email-authentication-failures-when-sending-mail-to-microsoft-36) across all registered domains belonging to the organisation
    - If legacy systems/applications dependent on SMTP exist, migrate them to separate subdomains on transactional email platforms such as [mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/docs/smtp-integration/),Â [postmarkapp](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/user-guide/send-email-with-smtp) orÂ [sendgrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/getting-started-smtp) to avoid reducing the security of the primary identity domains
- [Disable SMTP Auth for Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/authenticated-client-smtp-submission#disable-smtp-auth-in-your-organization) to simplify conditional access policies and avoid reconnaisance and exploitation of primary identity domains and mailboxes
- [Migrate file shares to OneDrive, Teams, and SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointmigration/fileshare-to-odsp-migration-guide) and enable [Microsoft Purview risk and compliance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/purview-compliance)
