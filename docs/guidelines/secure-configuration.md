# Secure Configuration Assessment Guideline

This guideline is intended to define a simple approach to ongoing monitoring and assurance of secure configuration of common tools and platforms.

## Email, File sharing and Endpoint configuration monitoring

The standard recommended actions within [Microsoft Defender](https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=actions) should be reviewed and exported each month and retained for 12 months.

### Enhanced validation of cloud service configuration

A backup of tenant configuration should be taken each month with [Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration](https://microsoft365dsc.com) and archived to a Git repository or equivalent VCS tool that allows monitoring of configuration drift.

A tool to review tenant configuration such as the [CISA ScubaGear M365 Secure Configuration Baseline Assessment Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear) should be run against all tenants at least quarterly with results reviewed and retained for 12 months to guide policy remediations and improvements.

### Enhanced validation of endpoint configuration

The [ACSCâ€™s Cyber Toolbox](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/news/essential-eight-assessment-guidance-package) is comprised of the Essential Eight Maturity Verification Tool (E8MVT) and the Application Control Verification Tool (ACVT) which should be run against a sampling of endpoints on at least a quarterly basis with results reviewed and retained for 12 months to guide policy remediations and improvements.

## Infrastructure (public cloud and on-premise compute and storage) configuration monitoring

The standard recommended actions within CSPM tools such as [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/~/5), [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), [Oracle Cloud Guard](https://www.oracle.com/au/security/cloud-security/cloud-guard/) and [Google Cloud Security Command Centre](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center) should be reviewed and exported each month and retained for 12 months. It is strongly recommended to ensure checks are configured against the ACSC ISM and NIST CSF (SP 800-53 R5) using compliance dashboards where possible:

- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Compliance Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/update-regulatory-compliance-packages)
- [Deploying a Conformance Pack Using the AWS Config Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-pack-console.html)
- [Oracle Cloud Guard](https://www.oracle.com/au/security/cloud-security/cloud-guard/) and [Oracle Data Safe](https://www.oracle.com/au/security/database-security/data-safe/)
- [Google Cloud Security Command Centre](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center)

## Addressing Microsoft 365 cloud service risks

Organisations with Microsoft 365 premium or enterprise licencing should at a minimum undertake the following basics:

- Enable security defaults in Azure Active Directory. Microsoft has published [guidance on enabling Security defaults](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#enabling-security-defaults). 
- Enrol your compatible devices in Intune. Microsoft has published guidance on [enrolling Windows devices in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-methods).
