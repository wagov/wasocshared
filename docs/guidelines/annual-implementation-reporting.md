## ACSC Strategies

This section provides guidance for the sheet **5. Strategies to Mitigate**.

The [ACSC strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents) are ranked in effectiveness of implementation based on the following terms. A maturity assessment tool for each strategy has been provided below with general guidance to enable assessors to determine the agency's implementation of the strategy.
