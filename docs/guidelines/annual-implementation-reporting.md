# Annual Implementation Report

This page has been designed to accompany the 2024 WA Cyber Security Policy Annual Implementation Report Template and provides additional guidance for assessors when answering questions in the provided template. The CSU requires that WA Government entities report against the [August 2023 (first published in November 2022)](../pdfs/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide.pdf){download="Essential Eight Assessment - August 2023"} for AIR reporting. This represents the 2022 maturity model.

## ACSC Strategies

This section provides guidance for the sheet **5. Strategies to Mitigate**.

The [ACSC strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents) are ranked in effectiveness of implementation based on the following terms. A maturity assessment tool for each strategy has been provided below with general guidance to enable assessors to determine the agency's implementation of the strategy.
