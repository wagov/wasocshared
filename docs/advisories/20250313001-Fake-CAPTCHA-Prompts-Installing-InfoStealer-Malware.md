# Fake CAPTCHA Prompts Installing InfoStealer Malware - 20250313001

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of a sophisticated malware campaign using fake CAPTCHA prompts, which if succesfully executed could deliver information-stealing malware on endpoint devices.

It first starts when a user visits a website, and gets prompts to prove they are not a robot, and lets the user click the reCAPTCHA verification tick box. In the background, the website visited copies a an encoded powershell command to clipboard, which runs invisibly and downloads a payload, delivering infostealer malwares like Lumma Stealer.

## What has been observed?

The WA SOC has conducted a Threat Hunt across visible data from WA SOC connected agencies in the sector, and have found an uptick on this behaviour.

Mshta is a command that will trigger the legitimate Windows executable mshta[.]exe. But mshta will fetch the malicious media file which is an encoded Powershell command from the specified domain and will run invisibly and download the actual payload, designed to steal sensitive information.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends administrators the following;
- Ran full anti-virus scan on the affected devices
- Isolate the affected devices and reimage
- Reset user's Active Directory password
- Revoke the user's session
