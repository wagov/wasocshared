# ArcaneDoor Exploiting Cisco ASA Vulnerabilities - 20240425001

## Overview

Cisco has released security updates to address ArcaneDoor—exploitation of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) devices and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software. A cyber threat actor could exploit vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-20353, CVE-2024-20359, CVE-2024-20358) to take control of an affected system.
