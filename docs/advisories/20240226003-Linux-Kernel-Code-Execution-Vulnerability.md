# Linux Kernel Code Execution Vulnerability - 20240226003

## Overview

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when we try to read from the partially-read skb.
