# Microsoft Win32k Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - 20230626001

## Overview

The kernel-mode driver in multiple versions of Microsoft Windows allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka "Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability".

## What is the vulnerability?

[**CWE-264**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/264.html) - Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system.
