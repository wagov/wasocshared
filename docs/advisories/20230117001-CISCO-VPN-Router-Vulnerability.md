# CISCO VPN Router Web-Based Interface Vulnerability - 20230117001

## Overview

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of some Cisco Small Business Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the web-based management process on the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. *The attacker must have valid administrator credentials.*

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the web-based management process to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.
