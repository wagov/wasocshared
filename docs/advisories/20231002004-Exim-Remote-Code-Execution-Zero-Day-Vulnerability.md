# (Zero Day) Exim AUTH Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - 20231002004

## Overview

The WA SOC has observed a critical zero-day vulnerability in all versions of Exim mail transfer agent (MTA) software that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the smtp service, which listens on TCP port 25 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. This issue can lead to software crashes or corruption of data following successful exploitation, it can also be abused by attackers for code or command execution on vulnerable servers.
