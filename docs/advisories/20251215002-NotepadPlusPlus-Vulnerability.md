# NotepadPlusPlus Vulnerability - 20251215002

## Overview

The WASOC have been made aware of a recent reports by security experts on the incidents of traffic hijacking affecting Notepad++. According to the investigation, traffic from WinGUp (the Notepad++ updater) was occasionally redirected to malicious servers, resulting in the download of compromised executables. In case an attacker is able to intercept the network traffic between the updater client and the Notepad++ update infrastructure, this weakness can be leveraged by an attacker to prompt the updater to download and execute an unwanted binary (instead of the legitimate Notepad++ update binary).
