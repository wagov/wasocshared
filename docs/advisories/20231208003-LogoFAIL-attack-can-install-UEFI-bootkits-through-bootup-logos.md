| [**CVE-2023-40238**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40238) | N/A        | A LogoFAIL issue was discovered in BmpDecoderDxe in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.2 before 05.28.47, 5.3 before 05.37.47, 5.4 before 05.45.47, 5.5 before 05.53.47, and 5.6 before 05.60.47 for certain Lenovo devices (but later, research found that the vulnerabilities affect beyond just Lenovo devices). Image parsing of crafted BMP logo files can copy data to a specific address during the DXE phase of UEFI execution. This occurs because of an integer signedness error involving PixelHeight and PixelWidth during RLE4/RLE8 compression. |

## What is vulnerable?

The vulnerability affects multiple devices (large majority of BIOS vendors):

- LogoFAIL is not silicon-specific and can impact x86 and ARM-based devices
- LogoFAIL is UEFI and IBV-specific

More information on the scale of the vulnerabilities or devices affected, refer to articles:

- [The Far-Reaching Consequences of LogoFAIL | Binarly](https://binarly.io/posts/The_Far_Reaching_Consequences_of_LogoFAIL/index.html)
- [Finding LogoFAIL: The Dangers of Image Parsing During System Boot | Binarly](https://binarly.io/posts/finding_logofail_the_dangers_of_image_parsing_during_system_boot/index.html)

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends ensuring latest firmware updates are applied across all applicable devices (as they become available) as per their vendors instructions. (refer [Patch Management](../guidelines/patch-management.md)).
