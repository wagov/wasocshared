# Word Press Plugin 3DPrint Lite Critical Vulnerability - 20240311003

## Overview

The plugin does not have any authorisation and does not check the uploaded file in its p3dlite_handle_upload AJAX action , allowing unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary file to the web server. However, there is a .htaccess, preventing the file to be accessed on Web servers such as Apache.
