# Bitdefender Releases Updates Fixing Critical Vulnerabilities - 20250313002

## Overview

Bitdefender has released updates to fix two critical vulnerabilities in Bitdefender BOX.

- The CVE-2024-13871 flaw allows an unauthenticated, network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- The CVE-2024-13872 flaw uses insecure HTTP protocols to download assets over the Internet which update and restart daemons and detection rules on devices. Such updates can be remotely triggered through ***/set_temp_token API method***, and the attacker can use man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques via remote code execution to return malicious responses.
