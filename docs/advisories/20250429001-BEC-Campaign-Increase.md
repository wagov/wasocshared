# Increased Business Email Compromise (BEC) Activity - 20250429001

## Overview

The WA SOC has observed an increase of activity relating to Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks.

## What is the threat?

Business email compromise (BEC) is a form of targeted phishing, or spear phishing. Criminals target organisations and try to scam them out of money or goods. They also target employees and try and trick them into revealing important business information.

Criminals use email to impersonate business organisations and representatives. This also includes using compromised accounts of employees as part of their tactics.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends administrators:

- Ensure all accounts are secured with phishing-resistant authentication methods where possible, such as Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), or utilising hardware security tokens: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-deploy-phishing-resistant-passwordless-authentication>.
- Enable "Automatic Attack Disruption" settings within their environments as per Microsoft Documentation where possible: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/automatic-attack-disruption>.
- Engage with Financial and Payroll teams to ensure there are established processes and procedures for verifying all financial related communications are legitimate, even from internal contacts and colleagues.
