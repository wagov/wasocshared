## What is vulnerable?

The vulnerability affects the following products:

- **NetScaler ADC** and **NetScaler Gateway**:

    - NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-8.50
    - NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-49.15
    - NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.19
    - NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.164
    - NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.300
    - NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.300

### Mitigations for Citrix Hypervisor

- CVE-2022-1304 is only exploitable at the point that the host administrator uses the "Restore Virtual Machine Metatdata" sub-option of the "Backup, Restore and Update" menu item in the on-host xsconsole interface. Customers who do not use this sub-option are not affected by this issue.

- CVE-2023-20588 only affects systems running on AMD Zen1 CPUs. Customers who are using other generations of AMD CPUs or who are not using AMD CPUs are not affected by this issue.

- CVE-2023-34326 only affects systems that have both of a) a PCI device passed through to the guest VM by the host administrator and also b) an AMD CPU. Customers who are not using AMD CPUs and customers who are not using the PCI passthrough feature are not affected by this issue.

- CVE-2023-34327 only affects systems running on AMD CPUs. Customers who are not using AMD CPUs are not affected by this issue.
