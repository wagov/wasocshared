# Medtronic Micro Clinician and InterStim Apps - 20230303002

## Overview

Medtronic Clinician (A51200) and InterStim X Clinicain App (A51300) contain a vulnerability that exists under certain reset conditions, which could cause the clinician application’s custom password to be reset to a default password. This could result in unauthorized control of the clinician therapy application, which has greater control over therapy parameters than the patient app. Changes still cannot be made outside of the established therapy parameters of the programmer. To gain unauthorized access, an individual would need physical access to the Smart Programmer.
