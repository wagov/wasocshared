# VMware ESXiArgs Ransomware Recovery Script Release - 20230208001

## Overview

CISA has released a recovery script for organisations that have fallen victim to ESXiArgs ransomware. The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on vulnerable ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable.

ESXi is VMwareâ€™s hypervisor, a technology that allows organisations to host several virtualised computers running multiple operating systems on a single physical server.

## What is the vulnerability?

- [**CVE-2021-21974 from VMSA-2021-0002**](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html) - **9.8 CRITICAL** - CVSSv3 Score. ESXi OpenSLP heap-overflow vulnerability. A malicious actor residing within the same network segment as ESXi who has access to port 427 may be able to trigger a heap-overflow issue in the OpenSLP service resulting in remote code execution.

- [**CVE-2020-3992 from VMSA-2020-0023**](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0023.html) - **9.8 CRITICAL** - ESXi OpenSLP remote code execution vulnerability. A malicious actor residing in the management network who has access to port 427 on an ESXi machine may be able to trigger a use-after-free in the OpenSLP service resulting in remote code execution.

## What is vulnerable?

The vulnerability affects the following products:

- VMware ESXi
- VMware vCenter Server (vCenter Server)
- VMware Cloud Foundation (Cloud Foundation)
- VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
- VMware Fusion Pro / Fusion (Fusion)
