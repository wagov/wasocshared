# NGINX HTTP/3 Vulnerability Patches Released - 20240604003

## Overview

NGINX has released security updates that address four vulnerabilities. These issues affect NGINX systems compiled with the ngx_http_v3_module module, where the configuration contains a listen directive with the quic option enabled. The HTTP/3 QUIC module is considered an experimental feature and is not compiled by default in NGINX OSS, but it is compiled by default in NGINX Plus.
