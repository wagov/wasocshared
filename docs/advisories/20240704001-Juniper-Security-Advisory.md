# Juniper Security Advisory - 20240704001

## Overview

An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).
The PFE will crash and restart if an SRX Series device receives specific valid traffic destined to the device. Continued traffic receipt and processing will create a sustained DoS condition.
