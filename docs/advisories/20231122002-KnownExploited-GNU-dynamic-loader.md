# Known Exploited Vulnerability - GNU C Library Dynamic Loader - 20231122002

## Overview

CISA have added **CVE-2023-4911** to their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue.

This vulnerability was introduced in glibc version 2.34. RHEL-8 ships glibc 2.28, which is not originally affected by this vulnerability. However, the commit that introduced this vulnerability was backported to RHEL-8.5, making this version and onward vulnerable. RHEL-8.4 and older are not affected by this vulnerability.
