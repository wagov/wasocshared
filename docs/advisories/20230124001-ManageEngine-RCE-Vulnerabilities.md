# ManageEngine RCE Vulnerability Known Exploitation - 20230124001

## Overview

ManageEngine has released an advisory to address unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities across multiple ManageEngine OnPremise products due to the usage of an outdated third party dependency.

## What is the vulnerability?

[**CVE-2022-47966**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-47966) - CVSS Score 8.1: Multiple Zoho ManageEngine on-premise products, such as ServiceDesk Plus through 14003, allow remote code execution due to use of Apache xmlsec (aka XML Security for Java) 1.4.1, because the xmlsec XSLT features, by design in that version, make the application responsible for certain security protections, and the ManageEngine applications did not provide those protections.

## What is vulnerable?

ManageEngine has noted the following products and versions to be impacted by the vulnerability:
