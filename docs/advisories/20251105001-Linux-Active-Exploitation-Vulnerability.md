# Linux Active Exploitation Vulnerability - 20251105001

## Overview

A vulnerability exists in Linux Kernel that involves incorrect pruning logic in the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) verifier, which incorrectly marks unsafe code paths as safe. This flaw allows threat actor to perform arbitrary read/write operations in kernel memory, leading to lateral privilege escalation and potentially container escape.
