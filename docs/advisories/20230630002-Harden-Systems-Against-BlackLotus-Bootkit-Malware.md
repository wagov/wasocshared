# Harden Systems Against BlackLotus Bootkit Malware - 20230630-002

## Overview

BlackLotus is a recently publicized malware product garnering significant attention within tech media. Similar to 2020's BootHole [CVE-2023-24932](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-24932), BlackLotus takes advantage of a boot loader flaw---specifically [CVE-2022-21894](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21894) Secure Boot bypass known as "Baton Drop"---to take control of an endpoint from the earliest phase of software boot.

MicrosoftÂ® issued patches for supported versions of Windows to correct boot loader logic. However, patches were not issued to revoke trust in unpatched boot loaders via the Secure Boot Deny List Database (DBX). Administrators should not consider the threat fully remediated as boot loaders vulnerable to Baton Drop are still trusted by Secure Boot.
