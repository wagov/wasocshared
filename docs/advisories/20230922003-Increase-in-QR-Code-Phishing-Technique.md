# Increase in QR Code Phishing (Quishing)- 20230922003

## Overview

The WA SOC has observed an increase in QR code related phishing across multiple organisations. Building up on a previous advisory dating back to the 10th of July 2023, found [here](20230710003-QR-Code-Phishing-Increase.md) we are providing further guidance and notification to inform organisations about the increased use of Quishing activity by Threat actors.

## Delivery

The primary method of delivery of the QR codes via phishing emails sent directly to user's inbox by compromised email addresses of legitimate organisations.

## What is the threat?

The QR code for Quishing will most likely be scanned with a user's mobile phone, and subsquently any click events or URL re-directs would therefore not be detected by SIEM/Email Security Gateway (ESGs).

## Recommendation:

- Increase end-user awareness on phishing attacks via QR code vectors.
- Agencies' Security Operations team(s) can perform proactive KQL threat hunting on potential QR Code phishing email(s) sent to agencies' user(s).
- Upon any successfully delivered phishing email to userâ€™s inbox, confirm with affected user(s) whether they have scanned the QR code and have exfiltrated any credentials.

## Detection

Data sources, detection queries and triage information for the Quishing attacks are provided on the [**WASOC TTP Detection Guideline page as shown below**](<../guidelines/TTP_Hunt/ADS_forms/T1566.001-QR-CodePhishingAttachment(Quishing).md>).
