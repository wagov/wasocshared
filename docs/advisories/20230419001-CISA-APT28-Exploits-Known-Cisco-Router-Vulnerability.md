# APT28 Exploits Known Vulnerability on Cisco Routers - 20230419001

## Overview

WASOC has observed a [joint advisory](https://cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-108) from [NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/), [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/), and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) that provides details of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28's exploitation of Cisco routers in 2021.  By exploiting the vulnerability [CVE-2017-6742](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp), APT28 used infrastructure to masquerade Simple Network Management protocol (SNMP) access into Cisco routers worldwide, including routers in Europe, U.S. government institutions, and approximately 250 Ukrainian victims.

The WASOC requests WA Government agencies confirm with their network operators that unencrypted SNMP is only in use for monitoring, and has no ability to undertake administrative or privileged actions on network devices. Please inform the WASOC via the [DGov Incident Reporting Portal (IRP)](https://wasoc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) (using the vulnerability issue type) if there is any privileged access to unencrypted SNMP available on agency networks and the expected timeline for resolution if it is in use (target resolution should be 4-6 weeks maximum).
