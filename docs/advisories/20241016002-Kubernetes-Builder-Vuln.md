# Kubernetes Image Builder Vulnerability - 20241016002

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of a security issue discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder where default credentials are enabled during the image build process. Virtual machine images built using the Proxmox provider do not disable these default credentials, and nodes using the resulting images may be accessible via these default credentials. The credentials can be used to gain root access.
