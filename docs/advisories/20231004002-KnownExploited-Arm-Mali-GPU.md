# Known Exploited Vulnerability - Arm Mali GPU Kernel Driver Use-After-Free - 20231004002

## Overview

Arm officials wrote an advisory regarding active ongoing attacks targeting "Use-After-Free" vulnerabilities in device drivers for its Mali line of GPUs. These GPUs are run on a host of devices, including Google Pixels and other Android handsets, Chromebooks, and hardware running Linux.

## What is the vulnerability?

- [**CVE-2023-4211**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4211) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***TBA***: A local non-privileged user can make improper GPU memory processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.
- [**CVE-2023-33200**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33200) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***TBA***: A local non-privileged user can make improper GPU processing operations to exploit a software race condition. If the system’s memory is carefully prepared by the user, then this in turn could give them access to already freed memory.
- [**CVE-2023-34970**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34970) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***TBA***: A local non-privileged user can make improper GPU processing operations to access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds or to exploit a software race condition. If the system’s memory is carefully prepared by the user, then this in turn could give them access to already freed memory

## What is vulnerable?

The vulnerability affects the following products:

- Midgard GPU Kernel Driver: All versions from r12p0 - r32p0
- Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver: All versions from r0p0 - r44p0
- Valhall GPU Kernel Driver: All versions from r19p0 - r44p0
- Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver: All versions from r41p0 - r44p0

## What has been observed?

CISA added this vulnerabilty in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilties](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) catalog. There is no evidence of exploitation affecting Western Australian Government networks at the time of publishing.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends administrators apply the resolutions to all affected devices within expected timeframe of *48 Hours...* (refer [Patch Management](../guidelines/patch-management.md)):
