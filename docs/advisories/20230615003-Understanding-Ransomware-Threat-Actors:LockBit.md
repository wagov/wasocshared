# Understanding Ransomware Threat Actors: LockBit - 20230615003

## Overview

This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 13.1. See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables of LockBit’s activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques.

The LockBit RaaS and its affiliates have negatively impacted organizations, both large and small, across the world. In 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider in terms of the number of victims claimed on their data leak site.

## Delivery

LockBit affiliates have been observed using various freeware and open-source tools that are intended for legal use. When repurposed by LockBit, these tools are then used for a range of malicious cyber activity, such as network reconnaissance, remote access and tunneling, credential dumping, and file exfiltration. Use of PowerShell and batch scripts are observed across most intrusions, which focus on system discovery, reconnaissance, password/credential hunting, and privilege escalation. Artifacts of professional penetration-testing tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike have also been observed.

Table 4 of the [CISA advisory found here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-165a), shows a list of tools that are used by LockBit Affiliates.
