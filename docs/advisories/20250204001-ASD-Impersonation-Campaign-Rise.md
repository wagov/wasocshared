# Increase of ASD ACSC Impersonation Campaigns - 20250204001

## Overview

The ASD's ACSC is aware of emails and phone calls from cybercriminals claiming to be them.

The content of the scam emails and phone calls vary, but typically ask you to give personal information (such as passwords or bank details), money or ask you to download software.

To make the scam emails appear legitimate, cybercriminals have been using the ASD's ACSC logo and signature block.

The scam emails and phone calls also create a sense of urgency to try and pressure you into doing something quickly. Often, this will include threats that if you do not act now, something terrible will happen.

ASD willÂ **never**:

- Ask for your personal information such as your passwords, bank details or answers to your security questions.
- Send you an email with a link to 'antivirus' software or remote access applications such as 'AnyDesk' or 'TeamViewer'.
    - If you click on a link sent by a cybercriminal, there is potential that malicious software could be downloaded and installed to your computer.
- Ask you to purchase gift cards or cryptocurrency.
    - ASD's ACSC does not charge money for their services.
    - If you receive a call from someone claiming to be them regarding money or requesting you move your money out of your bank account, assume you have been contacted by a cybercriminal.
- Tell you that your IP is being used to access illegal websites or facilitate illegal activities, such as child exploitation material or money laundering.
- Stop you from hanging up the phone.
    - We will never threaten or pressure you to stay on the line.
    - A real ASD's ACSC employee will always encourage you to hang up and call 1300 CYBER1 to confirm you are speaking to us.
