## Overview

RunZero has published an article titled "runZero Research Uncovers Surprising Exposures in SSH Affecting Critical Network Security Devices and Applications".

## What is vulnerable?

The article details new research on Secure Shell (SSH) exposures and unveiled a corresponding open source tool named SSHamble which helps security teams validate SSH implementations by testing for uncommon, but dangerous misconfigurations and software bugs.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC highly recommends administrators review the article and apply the methodologies to assess their environments for identifying misconfigurations and/or vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the WA SOC recommends administrators review the ASD article "*Secure Administration*" for guidance on implementing security controls and best practices:
