# WordPress Plugin Critical Vulnerabilities - 20240819001

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of critical unauthorized access and deletion of data vulnerability affecting WordPress InPost Plugins.

Wordfence Intelligence have posted an advisory relating to a vulnerability caused by plugins `InPost for WooCommerce` and `InPost PL` for WordPress allowing unauthorized access and deletion of data due to a missing capability check on the 'parse_request' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read and delete arbitrary files on Windows servers. On Linux servers, only files within the WordPress install will be deleted, but all files can be read.
