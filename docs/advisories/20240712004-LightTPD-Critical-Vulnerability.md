# LightTPD Critical Vulnerability - 20240712004

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of a use-after-free vulnerability in lighttpd that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger lighttpd to read from invalid pointers in memory. The attacker can use crafted HTTP Requests to crash the web server and/or leak memory in order to access sensitive data. This vulnerability was fixed in 2018 by the lighttpd project. However, a number of implementations of lighttpd remain vulnerable due to a failure to apply the security updates provided by lighttpd.
