# Apache Superset Vulnerability Exposes Servers to RCE Attacks - 20230501001

## Overview

A default confirguration in Apache Superset allows it to be vulnerable to authentication bypass and remote code execution. According to [Horizon3](https://www.horizon3.ai/cve-2023-27524-insecure-default-configuration-in-apache-superset-leads-to-remote-code-execution/), Apache Superset used a default [Flask Secret Key](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/config/) to sign authentication session cookies. Attackers can use this default key to forge session cookies that allow them to log in with administrator privileges to servers that did not change the key.
