| [CVE-2023-7024](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-7024) | 8.8        | Heap buffer overflow in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.129 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [CVE-2023-7101](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-7101) | N.A        | Spreadsheet::ParseExcel version 0.65 is a Perl module used for parsing Excel files. Spreadsheet::ParseExcel is vulnerable to an arbitrary code execution (ACE) vulnerability due to passing unvalidated input from a file into a string-type “eval”. Specifically, the issue stems from the evaluation of Number format strings (not to be confused with printf-style format strings) within the Excel parsing logic. |

## What is vulnerable?

The vulnerability affects the following products:

- Google Chrome Versions before 120.0.6099.129
- ParseExcel Versions before 0.66

***Note: CVE-2023-7024 vulnerability could impact other chromium based browsers using WebRTC, and is not limited to Google Chrome.***

## What has been observed?

There is evidence of active exploitation of the vulnerabilities listed above.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends administrators apply the solutions as per vendor instructions to all affected devices within expected timeframe of *one month...* (refer [Patch Management](../guidelines/patch-management.md)):

- It is highly recommended to update to the following versions as soon as possible:
    - **Google Chrome Version** ***120.0.6099.129***
    - **ParseExcel** ***0.66***
    - Other chromium based browsers should be updated to their latest available versions
