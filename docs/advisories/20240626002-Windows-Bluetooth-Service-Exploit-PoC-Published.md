## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends administrators apply the solutions as per vendor instructions to all affected devices within expected timeframe of 48 hours (refer [Patch Management](../guidelines/patch-management.md)):


- [Windows Bluetooth Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-24871)

At the time of publishing, Microsoft only addresses the Remote Code Execution aspect but not the Local Privilege Escalation aspect. Therefore, it is recommended that administrators also take necessary actions to prevent Local Privilege Escalation
