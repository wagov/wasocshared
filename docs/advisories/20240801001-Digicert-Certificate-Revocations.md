## Overview

CISA has released an advisory related to DigiCert certificate revocations. 

DigiCert, a certificate authority (CA) organization, is revoking a subset of transport layer security (TLS) certificates due to a non-compliance issue with domain control verification (DCV). Revocation of these certificates may cause temporary disruptions to websites, services, and applications relying on these certificates for secure communication. DigiCert has notified affected customers and provided instructions on how to replace non-compliant certificates.
