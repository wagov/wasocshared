# Critical PuTTY Vulnerability Exposes Private Keys  - 20240419003

## Overview

A severe security flaw has been discovered in the popular SSH client PuTTY (versions 0.68 to 0.80), impacting a wide range of software including FileZilla, WinSCP, TortoiseGit, and TortoiseSVN. This defect drastically weakens private keys used in the ECDSA algorithm with the NIST P-521 curve, leaving them easily recoverable by attackers.

## What is vulnerable?

| CVE    | Severity     | CVSS | Product(s) Affected | Summary | Dated |
| ------ | ------------ | ---- | ------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| [CVE-2024-31497](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31497) | **Medium** | 5.9  | **versions 0.68 through 0.80, before 0.81** |    PuTTY generates random values (nonces) used within the ECDSA signature process. In the NIST P-251 configuration, the randomness is heavily biased. Attackers can exploit this bias to reconstruct the private key after collecting just 60 or so signatures created with the compromised key.     |     15/04/2024  |

## What has been observed?

There is no evidence of exploitation affecting Western Australian Government networks at the time of publishing.
