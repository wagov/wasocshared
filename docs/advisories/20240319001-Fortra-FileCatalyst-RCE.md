# Directory Traversal PoC in FileCatalyst Workflow - 20240319001

## Overview

A proof of concept (PoC) has been released for a vulnerability where the 'ftpservlet' of the FileCatalyst Workflow Web Portal may allow files to be uploaded outside of the intended 'uploadtemp' directory with a POST request. In situations where a file is successfully uploaded to a web portal's DocumentRoot, specially crafted JSP files could be used to execute code, including web shells.
