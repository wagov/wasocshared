# Critical Rust Standard Library Vulnerability - 20240416004

## Overview

The Rust Security Response WG has been notified that certain version of Rust standard library did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping.
