| [CVE-2023-22396](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22396) CVSSv3: **7.5 HIGH** |  **Junos OS**: Receipt of crafted TCP packets destined to the device results in MBUF leak, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) | 2023-01-11 | An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in TCP processing on the Routing Engine (RE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send crafted TCP packets destined to the device, resulting in an MBUF leak that ultimately leads to a Denial of Service (DoS). The system does not recover automatically and must be manually restarted to restore service. This issue occurs when crafted TCP packets are sent directly to a configured IPv4 or IPv6 interface on the device. Transit traffic will not trigger this issue. | **Immediately** [apply updates per vendor instructions](https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/2023-01-Security-Bulletin-Junos-OS-Receipt-of-crafted-TCP-packets-on-Ethernet-console-port-results-in-MBUF-leak-leading-to-Denial-of-Service-DoS-CVE-2023-22396?language=en_US). |
| [CVE-2023-22410](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22410) CVSSv3: **7.5 HIGH** | **Junos OS: MX Series with MPC10/MPC11:** When Suspicious Control Flow Detection (scfd) is enabled and an attacker is sending specific traffic, this causes a memory leak | 2023-01-11 | A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series platforms with MPC10/MPC11 line cards, allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Devices are only vulnerable when the Suspicious Control Flow Detection (scfd) feature is enabled. Upon enabling this specific feature, an attacker sending specific traffic is causing memory to be allocated dynamically and it is not freed. Memory is not freed even after deactivating this feature. Sustained processing of such traffic will eventually lead to an out of memory condition that prevents all services from continuing to function, and requires a manual restart to recover. The FPC memory usage can be monitored using the CLI command "show chassis fpc". | **Immediately** [apply updates per vendor instructions](https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/2023-01-Security-Bulletin-Junos-OS-MX-Series-with-MPC10-MPC11-When-Suspicious-Control-Flow-Detection-scfd-is-enabled-and-an-attacker-is-sending-specific-traffic-this-causes-a-memory-leak-CVE-2023-22410?language=en_US). |
