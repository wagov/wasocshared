# Grav CMS Vulnerability Opens Door to Account Takeovers - 20240521001

## Overview

Grav, a file-based Web platform, contains a vulnerability that could allow a low privilege user account with page edit privilege to read any server files using Twig Syntax. This includes Grav user account files - `/grav/user/accounts/*.yaml`. This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. A cyber threat actor could leverage this flaw to compromise any registered account and read any file on the web server by resetting a user's password in order to obtain the password reset token from the file, or by cracking the hashed password.
