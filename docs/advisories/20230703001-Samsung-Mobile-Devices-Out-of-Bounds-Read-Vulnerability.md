# Samsung Mobile Devices Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability - 20230703001

## Overview

Samsung mobile devices contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability within the modem interface driver due to a lack of boundary checking of a buffer in set_skb_priv(), leading to remote code execution by dereference of an invalid function pointer.

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. Typically, this can allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash. A crash can occur when the code reads a variable amount of data and assumes that a sentinel exists to stop the read operation, such as a NUL in a string. The expected sentinel might not be located in the out-of-bounds memory, causing excessive data to be read, leading to a segmentation fault or a buffer overflow. The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent read operation then produces undefined or unexpected results.
## What is the vulnerability?
