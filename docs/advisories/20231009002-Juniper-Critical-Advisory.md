# Juniper Announce RCE Chain Vulnerability Variation - 20231009002

## Overview

Juniper published an update to an existing advisory regarding a variation of the exploit for the code execution vulnerability (CVE-2023-36845).

## What is the vulnerability?

- [**CVE-2023-36844**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36844) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***5.3***: A PHP External Variable Modification vulnerability in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to control certain, important environment variables. Using a crafted request an attacker is able to modify certain PHP environment variables leading to partial loss of integrity, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.
- [**CVE-2023-36845**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36845) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***9.8***: A PHP External Variable Modification vulnerability in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to remotely execute code. Using a crafted request which sets the variable PHPRC an attacker is able to modify the PHP execution environment allowing the injection und execution of code.
- [**CVE-2023-36846**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36846) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***5.3***: A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity. With a specific request to user.php that doesn't require authentication an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity for a certain part of the file system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.
- [**CVE-2023-36847**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36847) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***5.3***: A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity. With a specific request to installAppPackage.php that doesn't require authentication an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity for a certain part of the file system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.
- [**CVE-2023-36851**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36851) - CVSS v3 Base Score: ***5.3***: A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity. With a specific request to webauth_operation.php that doesn't require authentication, an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity for a certain part of the file system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.
