# Samsung Mobile Devices Unspecified Vulnerability - 20230703006

## Overview

An improper boundary check in DSP driver prior to SMR Mar-2021 Release 1 allows out of bounds memory access. The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. Typically, this can result in corruption of data, a crash, or code execution. The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent write operation then produces undefined or unexpected results.
