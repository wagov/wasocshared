# Microsoft June 2024 Patch Fixes Critical RCE Vulnerability - 20240612001

## Overview

Microsoft's June 2024 Patch Tuesday addresses a number of serious vulnerabilities, including 18 remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, with one being a critical RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ).

The Windows message queuing service, which is a Windows component, needs to be enabled for a system to be exploitable by this vulnerability. An attacker would need to send a specially crafted malicious MSMQ packet to a MSMQ server. This could result in remote code execution on the server side.
