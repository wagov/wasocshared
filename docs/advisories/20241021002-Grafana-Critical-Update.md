# Grafana Releases Critical Update - 20241021002

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of a critical vulnerability in Grafana's SQL Expressions experimental feature where insufficient query sanitisation could lead to command injection and local file inclusion from any user with VIEWER or higher permissions.
