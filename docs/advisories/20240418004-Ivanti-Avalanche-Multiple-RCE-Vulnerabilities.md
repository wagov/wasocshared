## What has been observed?

There is no evidence of exploitation affecting Western Australian Government networks at the time of publishing.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends administrators apply the solutions as per vendor instructions to all affected devices within expected timeframe of *one month...* (refer [Patch Management](../guidelines/patch-management.md)):

- It is highly recommended to update to Avalanche version 6.4.3 or later: [Download](https://www.wavelink.com/download/Downloads.aspx?DownloadFile=27687&returnUrl=/Download-Avalanche_Mobile-Device-Management-Software/)
