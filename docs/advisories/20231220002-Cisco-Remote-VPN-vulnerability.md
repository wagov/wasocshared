# Cisco Remote VPN vulnerability - 20231220002

## Overview

A vulnerability in the remote access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a brute force attack in an attempt to identify valid username and password combinations or an authenticated, remote attacker to establish a clientless SSL VPN session with an unauthorized user.

## What is the vulnerability?

[**CVE-2023-20269**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20269) - CVSS v3.1 Base Score: ***9.1***

This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) between the remote access VPN feature and the HTTPS management and site-to-site VPN features. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following:

- Identify valid credentials that could then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session.
- Establish a clientless SSL VPN session (only when running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier).

## What is vulnerable?

- Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
- Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software

## What has been observed?

The WASOC has been made aware of attempted explotation of this vulnerability on WA Government Entities infrastructure.
