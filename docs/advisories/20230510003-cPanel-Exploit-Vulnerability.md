## What is vulnerable?

The vulnerability affects the following products:

- All cPanel builds **prior to** - **11.102.0.31**
- cPanel builds - **11.102.0.32** - **11.106.0.17**
- cPanel builds - **11.102.0.19** - **11.108.0.12**
- cPanel builds - **11.108.0.14** - **11.109.9999.115**

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends administrators upgrade to any of the following versions or later:

- Build **11.109.9999.116**
- Build **11.108.0.13**
- Build **11.106.0.18**
- Build **11.102.0.31**

- **Beef up filter checking for invalid webmail forwarders**:
- Putting back-slashes before and after forbidden webmail forwarder words (such as include) will allow it to go through. It is recommended to improve any filters to catch this.

- **Escape HTML message in cpsrvd's error page**:
- An invalid webcall ID can contain cross-site scripting content and needs to be escaped when displayed on the error page for cpsrvd. By escaping the HTML message in the error page we can prevent cross-site scripting from this source as well as any other source that makes it onto the error page.
