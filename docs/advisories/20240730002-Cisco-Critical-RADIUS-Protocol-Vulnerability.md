# Cisco Critical RADIUS Protocol Vulnerability - 20240730002

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of a vulnerability in the RADIUS protocol, a widely used authentication and authorization framework for network access.
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the MD5 Response Authenticator signature used in the RADIUS protocol. An attacker with network access can exploit this flaw to forge RADIUS responses, effectively bypassing authentication measures. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive network resources.
