# Microsoft Vulnerability Known Exploitation - 20240906002

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of active exploitation of published analysis and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a critical zero-day vulnerability in the Windows Kernel. The vulnerability resides in the core of the Windows operating system, specifically within the ntoskrnl.exe process, also known as the Windows NT Operating System Kernel Executable. This kernel is a fundamental component of Windows, acting as the bridge between hardware and software, and is critical for the efficient functioning of numerous Windows services. The vulnerability stems from a race condition, a scenario where the outcome depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events. In this case, an attacker who successfully exploits the race condition could elevate their privileges to the SYSTEM level, effectively gaining full control over the targeted machine.
