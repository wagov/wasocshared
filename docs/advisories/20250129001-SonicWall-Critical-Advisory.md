# SonicWall Critical Advisory - 20250129001

## Overview

The WA SOC has been made aware of a critical authentication vulnerability in SonicOS products.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to hijack existing authenticated client SSLVPN sessions. Multi-factor authentication is bypassed during exploitation, facilitating initial access even via accounts with MFA enabled. Exploitation does not require the knowledge of an existing username or password.
