# Cisco Publishes Known Exploitation Advisory - 20250224001

## Overview

Cisco has confirmed that a Chinese threat actor known as Salt Typhoon gained access by likely abusing a known security flaw tracked as CVE-2018-0171, and by obtaining legitimate victim login credentials as part of a targeted campaign aimed at major U.S. telecommunications companies. No new Cisco vulnerabilities were discovered during this campaign. While there have been some reports that Salt Typhoon is abusing three other known Cisco vulnerabilities, Cisco have not identified any evidence to confirm these claims. The vulnerabilities in question are listed below. Note that each of these CVEs have security fixes available. Threat actors regularly use publicly available malicious tooling to exploit these vulnerabilities, making patching of these vulnerabilities imperative.
