# CISA Releases Joint Advisory for North Korean Cyber Espionage Activity - 20240726001

## Overview

CISA has released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory titled "North Korea State-Sponsored Cyber Group Conducts Global Espionage Campaign to Advance Regime's Military and Nuclear Programs". This advisory was crafted to highlight cyber espionage activity associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) 3rd Bureau based in Pyongyang and Sinuiju.

The Advisory states that the group primarily targets defence, aerospace, nuclear, and engineering entities to obtain sensitive and classified technical information and intellectual property to advance the regime’s military and nuclear programs and ambitions. The authoring agencies believe the group and the cyber techniques remain an ongoing threat to various industry sectors worldwide, including but not limited to entities in their respective countries, as well as in Japan and India.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC encourages all critical infrastructure organisations to review the advisory for listed known TTPs for conducting surveillance within their environments, and implement the recommended mitigations where applicable.
