# Critical PuTTY Vulnerability Exposes Private Keys  - 20240419003

## Overview

A severe security flaw has been discovered in the popular SSH client PuTTY (versions 0.68 to 0.80), impacting a wide range of software including FileZilla, WinSCP, TortoiseGit, and TortoiseSVN. This defect drastically weakens private keys used in the ECDSA algorithm with the NIST P-521 curve, leaving them easily recoverable by attackers.
