# ASD Publishes Joint Advisory - 20240927001

## Overview

The Australian Signals Directorate Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD ACSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and other U.S. and international partners released the joint guide on **Detecting and Mitigating Active Directory Compromises**

## What has been observed?

This guidance aims to inform organisations about 17 common techniques used to target Active Directory as observed by the authoring agencies. This guidance provides an overview of each technique and how it can be leveraged by malicious actors, and recommended strategies to mitigate these techniques. By implementing the recommendations in this guidance, organisations can significantly improve their Active Directory security, and therefore their overall network security, to prevent intrusions by malicious actors.

## Recommendation

The WA SOC recommends:

- **ASD Advisory:** <https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/detecting-and-mitigating-active-directory-compromises>
- Review **Appendix A: Active Directory security controls** and implement these controls.
- Review **Appendix B: Active Directory events** and ensure that the recommended events are being logged.
