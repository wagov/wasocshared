# Erlang/OTP SSH Vulnerability - 20250811001

## Overview

A critical vulnerability has been identified that may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorised access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials.

Due to Erlang/OTP being a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language, it is incorporated in multiple products which may be in use without being initially obvious. The WASOC recommends administrators review the list of affected products to determine if this affects their environment.
