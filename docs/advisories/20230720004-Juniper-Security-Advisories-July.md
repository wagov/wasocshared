# An Out-of-Cycle Security Bulletin: Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved - 20230720004

## Overview

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) update message is received over an established BGP session, and that message contains a specific, optional transitive attribute, this session will be torn down with an update message error. This issue cannot propagate beyond an affected system as the processing error occurs as soon as the update is received. This issue is exploitable remotely as the respective attribute can propagate through unaffected systems and intermediate autonomous system (AS) (if any).

Continuous receipt of a BGP update containing this attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
