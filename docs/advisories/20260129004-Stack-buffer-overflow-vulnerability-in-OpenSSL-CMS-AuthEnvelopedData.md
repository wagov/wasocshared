# Stack buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenSSL - 20260129004

## Overview

The WASOC has become aware of a vulnerbility in OpenSSL that allows remote attackers to exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerability by supplying a crafted Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) message with an oversized Initialization Vector (IV) when parsing AuthEnvelopedData structures that use Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) ciphers such as AES-GCM. This can lead to a crash, causing a Denial of Service (DoS), or potentially allow for remote code execution.
