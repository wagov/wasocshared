# WA SOC Onboarding Procedure

## 1. Overview

!!! note

    This procedure is focused on establishing connectivity with the WASOC, please refer to [our guidance on configuring sentinel and defender](onboarding/sentinel-guidance.md) for how to implement the associated tooling rapidly.

There are 2 delegations of access an operational security team would need to assist a customer with managing their security events and detection rules. Our customer offerings below have been constructed around the type of ongoing access and assistance required:

**Tier 0 - Advisory:** Ability for automation accounts to read security incidents, alerts, identity and device information, event data, and azure subscription resources.

- Microsoft XDR Tenant (Azure AD) Role: [Reader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/create-custom-rbac-roles)
- Azure Subscription Role: [Reader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/general#reader)

??? note "Enhanced support tiers (optional)"

    **Tier 1 - Monitor:** Increased access for analysts to work on security incidents and detection rules ontop of **Tier 0**.

    - Microsoft XDR Tenant (Azure AD) Roles: [Global Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-reader), [Security Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#security-operator)
    - Azure Subscription Roles: [Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#reader), [Microsoft Sentinel Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#microsoft-sentinel-contributor)
    - Optional configuration of [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) (PIM) for elevated access to resources during critical incident response or service configuration activities (required under **Tier 2**).

### 1.1. Azure Subscription Access

![Sentinel Access](images/sentinel-incident.png)

As part of onboarding, the WASOC will send the customer a prefilled [Azure Lighthouse ARM Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer#create-your-template-manually) that can be installed as an **Service provider offer** to initiate an [Azure Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/overview) connection between the customer Azure Subscription and the WASOC Tenant. Once completed the WSOC can delegate relevant permissions to analysts and automation processes via privileged groups in the WASOC tenant, allowing it to service the customers Azure subscription. This process needs to be undertaken for each subscription the customer would like to delegate access to.

### 1.2. Microsoft XDR tenant access

![Defender XDR](images/xdr-overview.png)

As part of onboarding, the WASOC will send the customer a [Microsoft Entra ID Security group Object ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups#edit-group-settings) to allow delegated access to a specific group of users within the tenancy. This Security Group ID is applicable for step (TBD).

## 2. Onboarding Process

### 2.1. Prerequisites

- [Global Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator) permission required for the Azure AD Tenant and [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) permission required for the Azure Subscription(s).
    - [Access to Service provider offers](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_CustomerHub/ServiceProvidersBladeV2/~/providers) in the Azure Portal
    - [Access to Azure Active Directory Groups](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GroupsManagementMenuBlade/~/AllGroups) in the Azure Portal
- List of agency Azure AD Identities (as emails) that will require access to the WA SOC Incident Reporting Portal for collaboration on cyber security incidents.

## 3. Microsoft Sentinel Onboarding

### 3.1. Azure Subscription access delegation

The Azure subscription access can be delegated via the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/overview).

Navigate to the [Azure Lighthouse - Service Providers](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_CustomerHub/ServiceProvidersBladeV2/~/providers) page in the Azure portal, and select the arrow next to Add offer, and then select Add via template.

![service Provider](images/Service-Provider.png)

#### 3.2. Azure Lighthouse ARM Deployment

Browse for the template provided, and click **Upload**. This can be customised to removed unused groups if desired for the customers Tier - please inform the WA SOC of any changes prior to deployment to allow documentation to be updated.

![Upload Template](images/Upload-Template.png)

Review the custom deployment details and ensure the location is Australia East, then click **Review and create** then click **Create**.

### 3.3. Dedicated Cluster

The WASOC Dedicated Cluster program is an initiative to assist with reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of customers Sentinel Workspace. This is achieved by utilising a centralised [pricing model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters?tabs=cli#cluster-pricing-model) offered by Microsoft as part of the [dedicated cluster services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters?tabs=cli#advanced-capabilities).

??? note "Customer Prerequisite"

    The dedicated cluster has prerequisites that **must** be met to have the minimum technical requirements to onboard ([link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters?tabs=cli#link-a-workspace-to-a-cluster)) an sentinel workspace.

    The prerequisites as follows.

    - Must be on Microsoft [Enterprise Agreement](https://www.wa.gov.au/government/cuas/supply-of-microsoft-product-licences-and-licensing-solutions-cuams2019)
        - E licensing ([Compare Microsoft 365 Enterprise Plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft365-plans-and-pricing))

The onboarding to the Dedicated Cluster is handled entirely by the WASOC Engineers and can be facilitated upon request.

## 4. Microsoft XDR Onboarding

### 4.1. Microsoft Entra ID B2B Synchornisation

The WASOC leverages the [Microsoft Entra ID cross-tenant synchronisation services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure) to replicates WASOC analysts indentities from the source tenancy to the entities tenancy. This allows WASOC analysts to authenticate to entities XDR environment seamlessly.

### 4.2 XDR Unified RBAC Method

The new [XDR Unifed Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/manage-rbac) provides a single permissions management experience that provides one central location for administrators to control user permissions across different security solutions.

!!! note

    This solution is a recent addition to the Microsoft XDR and will require some administrative work by the entities to activate the [XDR RBAC experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/activate-defender-rbac#activate-in-microsoft-defender-xdr-settings). This work will require some pre-work with entities IT teams as exisiting permission to users and account may cause service interruption. [A mapping exercise will be required.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/compare-rbac-roles)
