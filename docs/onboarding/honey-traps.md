# WASOC Honey Trap (Pilot)

## Overview

!!! note
    This Honey Trap initaitve is pilot program for the WA SOC, as such the number participants for the pilot is limited.
    If interested in participating, please raise a request in the [WASOC IRP](https://irp.dpc.wa.gov.au/).

The WASOC is looking to expand the monitoring capability of Western Australian Government entities to better detect for advanced persistent threats (APT) on ICT infrastrcture. The WASOC will assist entities with the deployment of honey pots and honey tokens in infrastrcture locations that are commonly traversed by Threat Actors prior to a cyber incident.

Honey Pots and Honey Tokens are similar but decoy ICT services or data repositories that replicate the real ICT environment of organisations. These decoys are enticing targets for threat actors to attack and exploit. Once the actor has attacked the target, the Honey Pot or Honey Token will raise an alert due to unauthorised malipulation, thus allowing security teams to detect for broader threats to an entities ICT environments.

??? note "Pilot Participants Prerequisite" The pilot has prerequisites that must be met to have the minimum technical & commitment requirements to onboard to the Honey Trap Program.

The prerequisites as follows.

- Must have signed an exisiting MOU (T0,T1,T2) with the WASOC
- Pilot Participants must have a Mcirosoft Sentinel workspace located in region **Australia EAST**
- Must have been already onboarded to the WASOC via [Azure Lighthouse](https://soc.cyber.wa.gov.au//onboarding/#23-azure-subscription-access-delegation)
- Must have access to the [WASOC IRP](https://irp.dpc.wa.gov.au/) to raise Honey Traps request tickets.
- Must be able nominate a individual from your organisation to work closely with the WASOC Engineering Team.

The onboarding to the Honey Trap Platform is handled entirely by the WASOC Engineers and can be facilitated upon request.

## Onboarding Process

The WASOC has developed guidance to assist WA Government entities to integrate the Honey Trap platform into their exisiting Sentinel Workspaces can be found [here](https://github.com/wagov/wasoc-honeytraps).
