## Overview

VMware Cloud Foundation contains a remote code execution vulnerability via XStream open source library. A Proof-of-concept exploit code is available for a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely with root privileges on unpatched Cloud Foundation.

## What is the threat?

Unauthenticated threat actors can exploit it remotely in low-complexity attacks that will not require user interaction. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Critical severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 9.8.

- **CVE-2021-39144** - An attacker can send a specially crafted XStream marshalled payload with a dynamic proxy and trigger remote code execution in the context of root.

## What is vulnerable ?

- VMware Cloud Foundation (NSX-V) 3.11

## What has been observed ?

There is no evidence of exploitation affecting Western Australian government networks at the time of publishing.

## Recommendation

The Cyber Security Unit recommends Western Australian government organizations immediately:

- Review the [VMware security advisories](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0027.html) and validate which version of VMware Cloud Foundation your organization is running.
- If your organization is running a vulnerable version, we recommend you to review and follow patch instructions as recommended [here](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89809).
