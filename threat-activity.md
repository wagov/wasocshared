# WA SOC - Recent Threat Activity (April 2023)

During the month the WASOC has observed in the media an increase of supply chain attacks by threat actors compromising customers of Managed Service Providers (MSPs). Agencies should review the [ACSC guidance](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/managed-service-providers-how-manage-risk-customer-networks) on managing these risks. Close attention should be given to the access Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and vendors have over agency infrastructure, and the ongoing detective and protective security controls used to monitor and manage this.

To stay ontop of internet facing assets, please subscribe to daily exposure alerts from **[The ShadowServer Foundation](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/get-reports/)** (a highly trusted free resource sponsored by both [AusCERT](https://auscert.org.au/) and the [APNIC Foundation](https://apnic.foundation/) as part of the [ShadowServer Alliance](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/shadowserver-alliance-launch/). The WA SOC is investigating the best way to incorporate similar alerts into our whole of sector vulnerability monitoring services.
