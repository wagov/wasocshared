# WA SOC - Recent Threat Activity (January 2023)

Browsers ([Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox](advisories.md)) continue to be heavily targeted by threat actors, along with edge infrastructure ([Cisco, Fortinet, F5, Citrix, VMWare](advisories.md)). Microsoft Exchange continues to be extremely high risk to have exposed to the internet as the ongoing [ProxyNotShell](advisories/20221223002-Bypassing-ProxyNotShell.md) exploits highlight.

There was a major [Lastpass Breach](advisories/20221223001-Lastpass-breach-update.md) with evidence of content accessed in November 2022. General advice is to minimise use of shared credentials wherever possible, and research the organisational capabilities of password management tools, or defer to browser / operating system credential stores and services from existing trusted service providers.

**Phishing activity remains high** across all organisations with multiple incidents detected weekly. Please refer to the below guides to ensure all external and internal signins are appropriately monitored.
