# ACSC December 2022 ISM and E8 Updates - 20221202001

ACSC has recently issued a [December 2022 update](https://www.cyber.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-12/ISM%20December%202022%20Changes%20%28December%202022%29.pdf) to the Information Security Manual (ISM) including Essential Eight (E8) guidance which defines new requirements for patching controls:

- Undertake automated detection of assets at least fortnightly to inform vulnerability management.
- Ensure vulnerability scanners are using an up-to-date vulnerability database before conducting vulnerability scanning activities.

Both of the above are new requirements for **Maturity Level 1** and above under **Patch Applications** and **Patch Operating Systems**. Organisations should adopt these changes to the model as they are released, noting that DGov will incorporate these updates into the [WA Government Cyber Security Policy](https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/wa-government-cyber-security-policy) reporting process for 2023.
