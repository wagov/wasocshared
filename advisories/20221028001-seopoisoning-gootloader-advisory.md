## Overview

Since initial advice on the 19th of August 2022 (*SEO poisoning targeting public sector (Gootloader) Ref: 20220819002*), WA SOC have observed continuous active attempts of SEO poisoning for the deployment of Gootloader malware affecting multiple WA SOC agencies.

Based on multiple evidence we observed, we have updated threat hunting methods and detection for this attack.

### What is the threat?

Based on article written by Trend Micro, Gootkit loader uses fileless techniques to download and deliver various ransomware payload such as SunCrypt, and REvil (Sodinokibi) ransomware, Kronos trojans, and Cobalt Strike.

We have observed agency with EDR capabilities have been able to effectively stop GootKit/ Gootloader malware during the execution phase (when user accidentally clicked the malicious .js file). However, it should be noted that persistence mechanism might have been successfully installed to user device.

## Detection

### Detection/ Threat Hunting

Run the following threat hunting search on files and URLs that might be downloaded from GootLoader infected website

#### Non-KQL SIEM, search on the following regex-pattern on Files and File download origin

- File: `\((\d{4,6})\)\.zip`
- File URL origin: `\.php\?(.*=){3}.+$`

#### Microsoft Sentinel KQL / Defender Threat Hunting blade

```kusto
let url=dynamic(["setman.es","tavernelentrepot.be","termowood.net","textfabrik.de","sfl.hu","seyhanaluminyum.com","theodoraross.com","theairtrekstory.com","tavernelentrepot.be","serphero.com","shisharealty.com","sheffieldcoronarysociety.org.uk","thomadaneau.com","theodoraross.com","theairtrekstory.com","secora.cl"]);
let regx1=@"\((\d{4,6})\)\.zip";
let regx2=@"\.php\?(.*=){3}.+$";
union withsource=tablename_ DeviceNetworkEvents,DeviceFileEvents
| where RemoteUrl has_any (url) or FileOriginUrl has_any (url) or (FileName matches regex regx1 and FileOriginUrl matches regex regx2)
