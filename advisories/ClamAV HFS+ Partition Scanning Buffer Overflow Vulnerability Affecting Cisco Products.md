# ClamAV HFS+ Partition Scanning Buffer Overflow Vulnerability Affecting Cisco Products - 20230217001

## Overview

A vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library has been found on 15th of Feb, 2023.
This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in a heap buffer overflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV scanning process, or else crash the process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

## What is the vulnerability?
[**CVE-2023-20032**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20032)

## What is vulnerable? 

A vulnerability in the HFS+ partition file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
