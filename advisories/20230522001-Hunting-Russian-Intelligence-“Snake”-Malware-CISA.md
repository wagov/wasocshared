# Hunting Russian Intelligence “Snake” Malware | CISA - 20230522001

## Overview
A has released an advisory for the 'Snake' malware, which is a sophisticated cyber espionage tool that can steal sensitive information from various industries and sectors, potentially causing distruption to critical infrastructure systems.

## Summary
The Snake implant is considered the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool designed and used by Center 16 of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive targets. To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB's ultimate targets. Snake's custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.

CISA has identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, to include the United States and Russia itself. Although Snake uses infrastructure across all industries, its targeting is purposeful and tactical in nature. Globally, the FSB has used Snake to collect sensitive intelligence from high-priority targets, such as government networks, research facilities, and journalists. As one example, FSB actors used Snake to access and exfiltrate sensitive international relations documents, as well as other diplomatic communications, from a victim in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) country. Within the United States, the FSB has victimized industries including education, small businesses, and media organizations, as well as critical infrastructure sectors including government facilities, financial services, critical manufacturing, and communications.

This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides background on Snake's attribution to the FSB and detailed technical descriptions of the implant's host architecture and network communications. This CSA also addresses a recent Snake variant that has not yet been widely disclosed. The technical information and mitigation recommendations in this CSA are provided to assist network defenders in detecting Snake and associated activity. For more information on FSB and Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, please see the joint advisory [Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-110a) and CISA's [Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories ](https://www.cisa.gov/russia)webpage.

## What has been observed?
WA SOC has conducted a Threat Hunt accross the agencies in the WA Sector, and found no evidence of exploitation affecting Western Australian Government networks at the time of publishing.

## Recommendation

To view a comprehensive list of Mitigations and Prevention techniques, please refer to the [CISA - Hunting Russian Intelligence “Snake” Malware](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/advisories/hunting-russian-intelligence-snake-malware).

***Note** that the mitigations that follow are not meant to protect against the initial access vector and are only designed to prevent Snake's persistence and hiding techniques*.

### Change Credentials and Apply Updates
System owners who are believed to be compromised by Snake are advised to change their credentials immediately (from a non-compromised system) and to not use any type of passwords similar to those used before. Snake employs a keylogger functionality that routinely returns logs back to FSB operators. Changing passwords and usernames to values which cannot be brute forced or guessed based on old passwords is recommended.

System owners are advised to apply updates to their Operating Systems. Modern versions of Windows, Linux, and MacOS make it much harder for adversaries to operate in the kernel space. This will make it much harder for FSB actors to load Snake's kernel driver on the target system.

### Execute Organizational Incident Response Plan

If system owners receive detection signatures of Snake implant activity or have other indicators of compromise that are associated with FSB actors using Snake, the impacted organization should immediately initiate their documented incident response plan.

**We recommend implementing the following Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals** (CPGs) to help defend against FSB actors using Snake, or mitigate negative impacts post-compromise:

* CPG 2.A: Changing Default Passwords will prevent FSB actors from compromising default credentials to gain initial access or move laterally within a network.

* CPG 2.B: Requiring Minimum Password Strength across an organization will prevent FSB actors from being able to successfully conduct password spraying or cracking operations.

* CPG 2.C: Requiring Unique Credentials will prevent FSB actors from compromising valid accounts through password spraying or brute force.

* CPG 2.E Separating User and Privileged Accounts will make it harder for FSB actors to gain access to administrator credentials.

* CPG 2.F. Network Segmentation to deny all connections by default unless explicitly required for specific system functionality, and ensure all incoming communication is going through a properly configured firewall.

* CPG 2.H Implementing Phishing Resistant MFA adds an additional layer of security even when account credentials are compromised and can mitigate a variety of attacks towards valid accounts, to include brute forcing passwords and exploiting external remote services software.

* CPG 4.C. Deploy Security.txt Files to ensure all public facing web domains have a security.txt file that conforms to the recommendations in RFC 9118.
